00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:12.900
All right, my friends.

2
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:13.400
Hello.

3
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:13.600
Hello.

4
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.700
So I want to start off with a few questions.

5
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:41.600
And I know a lot of other presenters have already asked you questions and they've been kind of hard questions, but the questions I'm going to ask you are very, very simple and I promise you'll be able to answer these.

6
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:42.400
All right.

7
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.000
Are you ready for your first one?

8
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:51.200
OK, your first question is you don't have to answer out loud.

9
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.500
Are you having a good day?

10
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.600
OK, got your answer.

11
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:03.500
All right.

12
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:17.200
My second question for you is why, if you're having a good day, why are you having a good day?

13
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:25.200
Or if you're having a bad day, why are you having a bad day?

14
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:33.300
So I have one more question for you.

15
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:36.700
This should be the easiest one of all.

16
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.000
My last question is tomorrow.

17
00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:50.100
Would you rather have a good day or would you rather have a bad day?

18
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:55.500
Do you have your answer for that one?

19
00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:58.800
What about the day after tomorrow?

20
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:00.200
About Sunday?

21
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:01.700
Let's see.

22
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.700
Yeah, that's right.

23
00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:04.900
Tomorrow's Saturday, Sunday.

24
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:06.600
How about Monday?

25
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:20.100
Would you like to have a good day or a bad day on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, this time next week, good day or a bad day?

26
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:39.400
So that last question, like I said, is probably the easiest one for us to answer because we know the answer to that, don't we?

27
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:42.200
We want to have a good day every day.

28
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:50.000
Did anyone in the room answer, yes, I want to have a bad day on Monday?

29
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.200
Of course not.

30
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:54.500
We all want to have a good day every day.

31
00:03:00.901 --> 00:03:06.300
So this is really speaking to the type of happiness that we all wish for.

32
00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:18.100
In our heart of hearts, we have a good day when we are happy, and we want to be happy every day.

33
00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:22.700
There's never a day when we don't want to be happy.

34
00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:35.000
But whether or not we have good days or bad days really depends upon how we answered the second question.

35
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:37.200
Do you remember the second question?

36
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:39.200
What was the second question?

37
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:40.600
Why?

38
00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:43.100
Why am I having a good day?

39
00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:46.200
Why am I having a bad day?

40
00:03:50.201 --> 00:04:11.600
So one thing that my teacher says, his name is Geshikelseng Yapsa, and he says that much of the time, our mind is like a balloon in the wind, blown here and there by external circumstances.

41
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:14.300
Do you know that feeling?

42
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:22.600
He says when things are going well, when they're going our way, we feel happy.

43
00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:34.000
But then if something goes wrong, for example, he says, if we're forced to work with a colleague that we dislike.

44
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:38.800
But I'm sure none of you have colleagues you dislike, right?

45
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:44.300
He says.

46
00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:51.100
If we're forced to work with someone we dislike or if something doesn't go our way, then our happy feeling disappears.

47
00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:05.200
So as long as our answer to the question, why am I having a good day or why am I having a bad day?

48
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:07.700
Because, you know, this is a question people ask us.

49
00:05:07.701 --> 00:05:12.200
Like, maybe when you get home today, someone will go well, so how was that Ted thing?

50
00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:13.900
Did you have a good day?

51
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:18.000
And we'll say, yeah, yeah, I did.

52
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:34.300
There is this lady and she talked to us about how we need to be about compassionate towards former inmates and there is this performer who did this awesome be boxing thing with his mouth and you know this person and that person.

53
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:50.400
As long as our reasons for why we had a good day are a list of external conditions, then we're not going to have the stable happiness that we all want.

54
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:53.300
Does that make sense to you?

55
00:05:54.801 --> 00:06:14.300
Because if that's what our happiness depends upon, because we cannot control people and circumstances every single day, then our happiness will be in the hands of others, won't it?

56
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:19.500
It'll be at the whim of our circumstances.

57
00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:30.700
So if you really wish to have a good day every day, we've got two things we need to do.

58
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:48.200
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to stop outsourcing our happiness and outsourcing our unhappiness on the people and circumstances.

59
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:58.800
In other words, we need to stop attributing our happiness to what's going on externally.

60
00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:10.600
And we need to stop blaming others, especially blaming others for our unhappiness.

61
00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:35.500
So for as long as we do that, as long as we're making it the job of people and circumstances to make us happy, or as long as we're making it their fault when we're unhappy, our happiness will be very unstable and elusive.

62
00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:54.400
Our second job is to actively cultivate a source of peace and a source of happiness coming from inside our own mind.

63
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.600
So here's something I want you to commit to memory.

64
00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:02.900
Are you ready?

65
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:29.800
This is another line from one of my teachers books where he says happiness and unhappiness are states of mind and therefore their real causes cannot be found outside the mind.

66
00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:43.200
So if we have a peaceful state of mind, we will be happy regardless of people and circumstances.

67
00:08:44.401 --> 00:08:53.300
If our mind is unpeaceful or agitated, then even if we have very good circumstances, we'll find it impossible to be happy.

68
00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:09.500
So in other words, it's not what is happening that is making us happy or unhappy.

69
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:19.100
It is how we are responding to those things that determines whether we are happy or unhappy.

70
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:29.200
It is what our state of mind is like that determines our happiness or our unhappiness.

71
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:38.200
So how are we going to do this so we can all understand this?

72
00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:40.800
Like intellectually, It's not rocket science, is it?

73
00:09:41.201 --> 00:09:42.900
It's not hard to understand.

74
00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:49.800
And maybe to a certain extent, as I tell you these things, you're like, yeah, I knew that already.

75
00:09:50.201 --> 00:09:51.200
I knew that already.

76
00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:56.000
But how do we actually do it?

77
00:09:56.001 --> 00:10:07.600
How do we actually cultivate this stable Peace of Mind that we can rely upon regardless of the external circumstances?

78
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:13.700
So this is really where meditation comes into play.

79
00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:27.800
And I would say I would need a whole other Ted Talk hint, hint in order to really do the subject of meditation justice.

80
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:36.100
But for our purposes today, we can say that meditation is a mental action.

81
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:44.700
It's the mental action of concentrating on a peaceful, positive state of mind.

82
00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:56.300
If we do that, we concentrate on a peaceful, positive state of mind, then we can say we're meditating, whether that's like this, right?

83
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:03.000
See, actually, you don't know if I'm meditating or not because I could be thinking about my grocery list.

84
00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:14.600
It's only meditation if I'm actually focusing on a positive, peaceful state of mind.

85
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:17.400
But the trick is I can do it like this.

86
00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:19.800
This is called formal meditation.

87
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.400
But we can also learn to do this all the time in our daily life.

88
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:33.700
So see, here's a perfect opportunity.

89
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:38.500
We concentrate on a mind of patience.

90
00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:44.700
We're not disturbed, not unhappy, so why don't we try it now?

91
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:46.400
Are you up to up for it?

92
00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:47.700
Just a short meditation.

93
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:51.900
According to the clock, I've got 3 minutes left, so it's going to be a very brief one.

94
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:54.200
But let's actually try it.

95
00:11:54.201 --> 00:12:02.300
Let's try to tap into our own potential for a peaceful, positive state of mind.

96
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:19.300
So now I'll ask you just to sit comfortably and place your feet flat on the floor and your hands within your lap.

97
00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:39.700
And then you can lightly close your eyes and become aware of the sensation of your breath at the tip of your nose.

98
00:12:47.701 --> 00:13:20.500
And as you breathe out, you can imagine you are breathing out any agitation, any mental busyness, any frustration or unhappiness in your life, breathing it all out like dark smoke.

99
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:59.800
And as you breathe in, you can imagine and believe that you are breathing in a clear bright light, which is the very nature of inner peace.

100
00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:19.800
And you can imagine that this clear, bright light fills your entire body and mind.

101
00:14:36.901 --> 00:14:50.700
And for a few seconds, simply enjoy this inner peace coming from within.

102
00:15:10.801 --> 00:15:27.400
And now, as we finish, just be determined to bring this inner peace with you into the rest of your day to benefit yourself and others.

103
00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:33.200
So now we rise from meditation.

104
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:38.800
Thank you very much.
