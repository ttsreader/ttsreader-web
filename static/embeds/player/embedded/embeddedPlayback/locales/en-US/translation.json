We chose Microsoft / Google as they got the best results on our tests amongst the large automatic transcription providers.\n(4) Your transcription is then saved on our servers so you can access it anytime\n(5) As soon as it is ready you'll be notified by email.",

      "title": "Use cases. Saves you time & money. Here's how:",
      "desc": "Our goal is to save you time & money. Here are common use cases: \n\n\n(1) People who do their own transcribing use this service to prepare the first draft. This way, they can simply edit the results, in real time. While typing the whole text without this service would have taken a lot of effort and time: on average 5 times the length of the recording. \n\n(2) Index your audio archives, such that they will be searchable by text. Get to the correct recording and place within the recording thanks to our timestamps. \n\n(3) High quality recordings can achieve very high accuracy - as high as human transcription but at a fraction of the cost, immediate results and much better privacy protection. \n\n(4) For high confidentiality and privacy - when extra confidentiality and privacy are required, with our service no human sees, listens or handles your files. With us your files don't circulate between private computers. Human transcribers may not keep your files as safe as our machines do. Your audio files are deleted from our servers as soon as they are transcribed. The transcript is only on our servers under your account, so only you can access it.\n\n(4) For fast turnarounds. Get results as fast as the length of the file.\n\n(5) Transcribe lectures and interviews. Students and researchers use our service transcribing lectures and interviews in their research. Journalists transcribe interviews with our service in order to get quick results without the fear of leaking their professional materials. Then, they go on and edit only the portions that they are going to quote. They can find these parts easily within the audio file using our timestamped results. \n\n(6) Documenting protocols, meetings, where it's that or nothing. The low price enables transcription where otherwise would be out of reach.\n\n(7) For quickly understanding the content of the audio file, and jumping to the right location - ie search by reading at a glance instead of searching position by listening.\n\n(8) Translation of audio - by transcribing using Speechnotes Files and translating via any other translation service such as Google Translate",
