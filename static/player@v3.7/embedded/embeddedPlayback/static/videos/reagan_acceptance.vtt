1
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:14.200
For using up prime time.

2
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.500
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:32.100
Thank you.

5
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:37.700
We're singing our song.

6
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:52.400
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:58.300
Thank you.

8
00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:07.000
You're singing.

9
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.400
You're singing our song.

10
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:24.200
Well, the first thrill tonight was to find myself for the first time in a long time, in a movie on prime time.

11
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:40.500
But this, as you can imagine, is the second big thrill.

12
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:41.600
Mr.

13
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.600
Chairman, Mr.

14
00:01:44.601 --> 00:02:02.400
Vice President, to be this convention, My fellow citizens of this great nation, with a deep awareness of the responsibility conferred by your trust, I accept your nomination for the Presidency of the United States.

15
00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:36.100
I I do so with deep gratitude.

16
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:46.700
And I think also I might interject on behalf of all of us, our thanks to Detroit and the people of Michigan and of this city for the warm hospitality.

17
00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:09.200
And I thank you for your wholehearted response to my recommendation regard to George Bush as the candidate for vice president.

18
00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:21.200
I'm very proud of our party tonight.

19
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:45.300
This convention is shown to all America, a party united with positive programs for solving the nation's problems, a party ready to build a new consensus with all those across the land who share a community of values embodied in these words, family, work, neighborhood, peace and freedom.

20
00:03:48.001 --> 00:04:00.500
Now, I know that we've had we've had a quarrel or two, but it's only as to the method of attaining a goal.

21
00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:04.300
There was no argument here about the goal.

22
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:16.300
As president, I will establish a liaison with the 50 governors to encourage them to eliminate, wherever it exists, discrimination against women.

23
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:17.500
I will.

24
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:36.300
I will monitor federal laws to ensure their implementation and to add statutes if they are needed.

25
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:47.200
More than more than anything else, I want my candidacy to unify our country, to renew the American spirit and sense of purpose.

26
00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:56.400
I want to carry our message to every American, regardless of party affiliation, who is a member of this community of shared values.

27
00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:07.800
Never before in our history have Americans been called upon to face 3 grave threats to our very existence, anyone of which could destroy us.

28
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:15.600
We face a disintegrating economy, a weakened defense, and an energy policy based on the sharing of scarcity.

29
00:05:16.701 --> 00:05:32.300
The major issue of this campaign is the direct political, personal and moral responsibility of Democratic Party leadership in the White House and in the Congress for this unprecedented calamity which has befallen us.

30
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:48.100
They tell us they've done the most that could humanly be done.

31
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:54.600
They say that the United States has had its day in the sun, that our nation has passed its zenith.

32
00:05:55.201 --> 00:06:06.700
They expect you to tell your children that the American people no longer have the will to cope with their problems, that the future will be 1 of sacrifice and few opportunities.

33
00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:11.200
My fellow citizens, I utterly reject that view.

34
00:06:21.001 --> 00:06:41.900
The American people, the American people, the most generous on earth who created the highest standard of living, are not going to accept the notion that we can only make a better world for others by moving backward ourselves and those who believe we can have no business leading this nation.

35
00:06:53.701 --> 00:07:05.000
I will not stand by and watch this great country destroy itself under mediocre leadership that drifts when run crisis to the next, eroding our national will and purpose.

36
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:13.700
We have come together here because the American people deserve better from those to whom they entrust our nation's highest offices.

37
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.800
And we stand united.

38
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:21.700
We stand united in our resolve to do something about it.

39
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:30.100
We need a rebirth of the American tradition of leadership at every level of government and in private life as well.

40
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:39.000
the United States of America is unique in world history because it has a genius for leaders, many leaders on many levels.

41
00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:42.000
But back in 1976, Mr.

42
00:07:42.001 --> 00:07:43.900
Carter said, trust me.

43
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.100
And a lot of people did.

44
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:49.200
And now many of those people are out of work.

45
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:53.000
Many have seen their savings eaten away by inflation.

46
00:07:53.701 --> 00:08:01.500
Many others on fixed incomes, especially the elderly, have watched helplessly as the cruel tax of inflation wasted away their purchasing power.

47
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:05.200
And today, a great many who trusted Mr.

48
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:10.600
Carter wonder if we can survive the Carter policies of National Defense.

49
00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:19.300
Trust me, Government asks that we concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man, that we trust him to do what's best for us.

50
00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:29.900
For my view of government places trust not in one person or one party, but in those values that transcend persons and parties.

51
00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:44.800
The trust is where it belongs in the people.

52
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:50.500
The responsibility to live up to that trust is where it belongs in their elected leaders.

53
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:56.100
That kind of relationship between the people and their elected leaders is a special kind of compact.

54
00:08:56.801 --> 00:09:05.700
360 years ago, in 1620, a group of families dared to cross a mighty ocean to build a future for themselves in a new world.

55
00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:16.700
When they arrived at Plymouth, MA, they formed what they called a compact, an agreement among themselves to build a community and abide by its laws.

56
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:25.600
This single act, the voluntary binding together of free people to live under the law, set the pattern for what was to come.

57
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:35.200
A century and a half later, the descendants of those people pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to found this nation.

58
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:39.100
Some forfeited their fortunes and their lives.

59
00:09:39.801 --> 00:10:05.600
None sacrificed honor, 4 score and seven years later, Abraham Lincoln called upon the people of all America to renew their dedication and their commitment to a government of, for and by the people.

60
00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:21.500
Isn't it once again time to renew our compact of freedom, to pledge to each other, to pledge to each other all that is best in our lives, all that gives meaning to them.

61
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:28.600
For the sake of this, our beloved and blessed land together, let us make this a new beginning.

62
00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:42.900
Let us make a commitment to care for the needy, to teach our children the virtues handed down to us by our families, to have the courage to defend those values and virtues of the willingness to sacrifice for them.

63
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:57.300
Let us pledge to restore in our time the American spirit of voluntary service, of cooperation, of private and community initiative, a spirit that flows like a deep and mighty river through the history of our nation.

64
00:10:58.301 --> 00:11:08.400
As your nominee, I pledge to you to restore to the federal government the capacity to do the people's work without dominating their lives.

65
00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:41.200
I pledge to you, I pledge to you a government that will not only work well, but wisely, its ability to act tempered by prudence and its willingness to do good, balanced by the knowledge that government is never more dangerous, that when our desire to have it help us blinds us to its great power to harm us.

66
00:11:50.701 --> 00:12:09.500
You know the first, the first Republican president once said, while the people retain their virtue and their vigilance, no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can seriously injure the government in the short space of four years.

67
00:12:10.401 --> 00:12:11.000
If Mr.

68
00:12:11.001 --> 00:12:16.400
Lincoln could see what's happened in the last 3 1/2 years, he might hedge a little on that statement.

69
00:12:23.601 --> 00:12:28.500
But but with the virtues that are our legacy is a free people.

70
00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:38.200
And with a vigilance that sustains liberty, we still have time to use our renewed compact to overcome the injuries that have been done to America these past 3 1/2 years.

71
00:12:38.901 --> 00:12:41.300
First, we must overcome something.

72
00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:47.800
The present administration has cooked up a new and altogether indigestible economic Stew.

73
00:12:48.601 --> 00:13:01.600
One part inflation, one part high unemployment, one part recession, one part runaway taxes, one part deficit spending seasoned with an energy crisis.

74
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:05.300
It's an economic Stew that has turned the national stomach.

75
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:21.200
Ours are not problems of abstract economic theory.

76
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:35.600
These are problems of flesh and blood, problems that cause pain and destroy the moral fiber of real people who should not suffer the further indignity of being told by the government that it is all somehow their fault.

77
00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:38.900
We do not have inflation because, as Mr.

78
00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.800
Carter says, we've lived too well.

79
00:13:41.601 --> 00:14:00.000
The head of a government which has utterly refused to live within its means, and which has in the last few days told us that this coming year's deficit will be $60 billion, dares to point the finger of blame at business and labour, both of which have been engaged in a losing struggle just trying to stay.

80
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:20.400
Even high taxes, we are told, are somehow good for us, as if when government spends our money, it isn't inflationary, but when we spend it, it is.

81
00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:37.600
Those, those who preside over the worst energy shortage in our history tell us to use less, so that we will run out of oil, gasoline and natural gas a little more slowly.

82
00:14:38.401 --> 00:14:44.600
Well, now, conservation is desirable, of course, but we we mustn't waste energy.

83
00:14:45.001 --> 00:14:49.900
But conservation is not the sole answer to our energy needs.

84
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:53.900
America must get to work producing more energy.

85
00:15:03.901 --> 00:15:10.300
The Republican program for solving economic problems is based on growth and productivity.

86
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:26.600
Large amounts of oil and natural gas lay beneath our land and off our shores, untouched, because the present administration seems to believe the American people would rather see more regulation, more taxes, and more controls than more energy.

87
00:15:27.601 --> 00:15:29.300
Coal offers a great potential.

88
00:15:29.701 --> 00:15:31.100
So does nuclear energy.

89
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:47.800
Produced under rigorous safety standards, it could supply electricity for thousands of industry and millions of jobs and homes.

90
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:58.900
It must not be thwarted by a tiny minority opposed to economic growth, which often finds friendly ears in regulatory agencies for its obstructionist campaigns.

91
00:16:06.101 --> 00:16:15.600
Now, make no mistake, we will not permit the safety of our people or our environmental heritage to be jeopardized.

92
00:16:16.201 --> 00:16:25.300
But we are going to reaffirm that the economic prosperity of our people is a fundamental part of our environment.

93
00:16:32.501 --> 00:16:33.600
Our problems.

94
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:36.600
Our problems are both acute and chronic.

95
00:16:37.301 --> 00:16:48.200
Yet all we hear from those in positions of leadership are the same tired proposals for more government tinkering, more meddling and more control, all of which led us to this sorry state in the 1st place.

96
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:52.800
Can anyone look at the record of this administration and say well done?

97
00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:04.099
Can anyone compare the state of our economy when the Carter administration took office with where we are today and say keep up the good work?

98
00:17:07.001 --> 00:17:13.500
Can anyone look at our reduced standing in the world today and say, let's have four more years of this?

99
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:25.599
I believe the American people are going to answer these questions as you've answered them in the first week in November and their answer will be no, we've had enough.

100
00:17:33.101 --> 00:17:49.600
And then, and then it will be up to us, beginning next January 20th, to offer an administration and congressional leadership of competence and more than a little courage.

101
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:57.400
We must have the clarity of vision to see the difference between what is essential and what is merely desirable.

102
00:17:58.001 --> 00:18:02.700
And then the courage to bring our government back under control.

103
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:03.900
It is.

104
00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:06.200
It is essential.

105
00:18:10.301 --> 00:18:20.400
It is essential that we maintain both the forward momentum of economic growth and the strength of the safety net between those in our society who need help.

106
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:42.200
We also believe it is essential that the integrity of all aspects of Social Security be preserved beyond, Beyond these essentials, I believe it is clear our federal government is overgrown and overweight.

107
00:18:42.801 --> 00:18:46.300
Indeed, it is time our government should go on a diet.

108
00:18:56.801 --> 00:19:06.400
Therefore, my first act as chief executive will be to impose an immediate and thorough freeze on federal hiring.

109
00:19:18.201 --> 00:19:34.400
Then, then we're going to enlist the very best minds from business, labour and whatever, whatever quarter to conduct a detailed review of every department, Bureau and agency that lives by federal appropriation.

110
00:19:42.101 --> 00:19:55.100
And we're going to enlist the help and ideas of many dedicated and hard working government employees at all levels who want a more efficient government just as much as the rest of us do.

111
00:19:59.401 --> 00:19:59.800
I.

112
00:20:02.001 --> 00:20:10.300
I know that many of them are demoralized by the confusion and waste they confront in their work as a result of failed and failing policies.

113
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:15.100
Our instructions to the groups we enlist will be simple and direct.

114
00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:26.600
We will remind them that government programs exist at the sufferance of the American taxpayer and are paid for with money earned by working men and women.

115
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:37.100
And programs that represent a waste of their money, a theft from their pocketbooks, must have that waste eliminated or that program must go.

116
00:20:49.801 --> 00:20:55.800
It must go by executive order where possible, by congressional action where necessary.

117
00:20:56.601 --> 00:21:15.000
Everything that can be run more effectively by state and local government we shall turn over to State and local government, along along with the funding sources to pay for it.

118
00:21:15.601 --> 00:21:27.000
We're going to put an end to the money merry go round, where our money becomes Washington's money to be sent by States and cities exactly the way the federal bureaucrats tell us it has to be spent.

119
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:46.500
I will not accept the excuse that the federal government has grown so big and powerful that it is beyond the control of any president, any administration or Congress.

120
00:21:46.801 --> 00:22:00.400
We are going to put an end to the notion that the American taxpayer exists to fund the federal government, the federal government, The federal government exists to serve the American people.

121
00:22:29.001 --> 00:22:33.800
On January 20th, we are going to re establish that truth.

122
00:22:34.401 --> 00:22:45.000
Also on that date, we are going to initiate action to get substantial relief for our taxpaying citizens and action to put people back to work.

123
00:22:52.801 --> 00:22:58.700
None of this, none of this will be based on any new form of monetary tinkering or fiscal sleight of hand.

124
00:22:59.401 --> 00:23:05.500
We will simply apply to government the common sense that we all use in our daily lives.

125
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:14.100
Work, work and family are at the center of our lives.

126
00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:16.500
The foundation of our dignity is a free people.

127
00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:24.000
When we deprive people of what they've earned or take away their jobs, we destroy their dignity and undermine their families.

128
00:23:24.501 --> 00:23:34.300
We can't support families unless there are jobs, and we can't have jobs unless the people have both money to invest and the faith to invest it.

129
00:23:42.301 --> 00:23:59.600
These these are concepts that stem from an economic system that for more than 200 years has helped us master a continent, create a previously undreamed of prosperity for our people, and has fed millions of others around the globe.

130
00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:14.100
And that system will continue to serve us in the future if our government will stop ignoring the basic values on which it was built and stop betraying the trust and goodwill of the American workers who keep it were going.

131
00:24:26.201 --> 00:24:35.400
The American people are carrying the heaviest peacetime tax burden in our nation's history, and it will grow even heavier under present law next January.

132
00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:44.100
We're taxing ourselves into economic exhaustion and stagnation, crushing our ability and incentive to save, invest and produce.

133
00:24:44.701 --> 00:24:45.600
This must stop.

134
00:24:46.301 --> 00:24:50.900
We must halt this fiscal self destruction and restore sanity to our economic system.

135
00:24:51.601 --> 00:24:58.000
I've long advocated a 30% reduction in income tax rates over a period of three years.

136
00:24:58.701 --> 00:25:18.500
This phase tax reduction, this phase tax reduction would begin with a 10% down payment tax cut in 1981, which the Republicans in Congress and I have already proposed.

137
00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:26.400
A phased reduction of tax rates would go a long way toward easing the heavy burden on the American people.

138
00:25:26.701 --> 00:25:28.200
But we shouldn't stop there.

139
00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:38.400
Within the context of economic conditions and appropriate budget priorities during each fiscal year of my presidency, I would strive to go further.

140
00:25:38.901 --> 00:26:03.300
This would include improvement in business, depreciation, taxes so we can stimulate investment in order to get plants and equipment replaced, put more Americans back to work, and put our nation back on the road to being competitive in world commerce.

141
00:26:03.701 --> 00:26:09.100
We will also work to reduce the cost of government as a percentage of our gross national product.

142
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:28.500
The first task of national leadership is to set realistic and honest priorities in our policies and our budget, and I pledge that my administration will do that.

143
00:26:29.201 --> 00:26:46.200
When I talk of tax cuts, I'm reminded that every major tax cut in this century has strengthened the economy, generated renewed productivity, and ended up yielding new revenues for the government by creating new investment, new jobs, and more commerce among our people.

144
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:58.200
The present administration, the present administration has been forced by us Republicans to play follow the leader with regard to a tax cut.

145
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:10.800
But in this election year, we must take with the proverbial grain of salt any tax cut proposed by those who have already given us the greatest single tax increase in our nation's history.

146
00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:21.000
When those when those in leadership give U.S.

147
00:27:21.001 --> 00:27:31.100
tax increases and tell us we must also do with less, have they thought about those who've always had less, especially the minorities?

148
00:27:31.701 --> 00:27:39.200
This is like telling them that just as they step on that first rung of the ladder of opportunity, the ladder is being pulled out from under them.

149
00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:56.300
That may be the Democratic leadership's message to the minorities, but it won't be our message ours.

150
00:27:57.001 --> 00:27:58.000
Ours will be.

151
00:27:58.001 --> 00:28:02.500
We have to move ahead, but we're not going to leave anyone behind.

152
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:15.900
Thanks to the economic policies of the Democratic Party, millions of Americans find themselves out of work.

153
00:28:16.601 --> 00:28:23.500
Millions more have never even had a fair chance to learn new skills, hold a decent job, or secure for themselves and their families.

154
00:28:24.301 --> 00:28:27.600
A prosper a share in the prosperity of this nation.

155
00:28:28.301 --> 00:28:33.500
It's time to put America back to work, to make our cities and towns.

156
00:28:34.401 --> 00:28:45.700
Make our cities and towns resound with the confident voices of men and women of all races, nationalities and faiths, bringing home to their families a paycheck they can cash for honest money.

157
00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:59.600
For those without skills, we'll find a way to help them get new skills.

158
00:28:59.901 --> 00:29:06.300
For those without job opportunities, we'll stimulate new opportunities, particularly in the inner cities where they live.

159
00:29:07.101 --> 00:29:15.100
For those who've abandoned hope, we'll restore hope, and we'll welcome them into a great national crusade to make America great again.

160
00:29:22.901 --> 00:29:31.000
When we move from domestic affairs and cast our eyes abroad, we see an equally sorry chapter in the record of the present administration.

161
00:29:32.001 --> 00:29:36.900
A Soviet combat brigade trains in Cuba, just 90 miles from our shores.

162
00:29:37.701 --> 00:29:43.100
A Soviet army of invasion occupies Afghanistan, further threatening our vital interests in the Middle East.

163
00:29:43.701 --> 00:29:53.400
America's defense strength is at its lowest ebb in a generation, while the Soviet Union is vastly outspending us in both strategic and conventional arms.

164
00:29:54.101 --> 00:30:01.500
Our European allies, looking nervously at the growing menace from the East, turned to us for leadership and failed to find it.

165
00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:04.600
And incredibly, more than 50.

166
00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:19.400
As you've been told from this platform so eloquently already, more than fifty of our fellow Americans have been held captive for over 8 years, 8 months, by a dictatorial foreign power that holds us up to ridicule before the world.

167
00:30:20.101 --> 00:30:33.400
Adversaries large and small test our will and seek to confound our resolve, but we are given weakness when we need strength, vacillation when the times demand firmness.

168
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:45.200
The Carter administration lives in a world of make believe every day drawing up a response to that day's problems, troubles, regardless of what happened yesterday and what will happen tomorrow.

169
00:30:45.801 --> 00:30:52.200
But you and I live in a real world where disasters are overtaking our nation without any real response from Washington.

170
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:58.300
This is make believe, self deceit, and above all transparent hypocrisy.

171
00:30:58.901 --> 00:31:05.800
For example, Mr.

172
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:07.300
Carter, Mr.

173
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:19.300
Carter says he supports the volunteer army, but he lets military pay and benefits slip so low that many of our enlisted personnel are actually eligible for food stamps re enlistment rates drop.

174
00:31:19.701 --> 00:31:42.300
And just recently, after he fought all week against a proposed pay increase for our men and women in the military, he then helicoptered out to the carrier, the USS Nimitz, which was returning from long months of duty in the Indian Ocean, and told the crew of that ship that he advocated better pay for them and their comrades.

175
00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:46.000
Where does he really stand now that he's back on shore?

176
00:31:57.801 --> 00:32:00.200
Well I'll I'll tell you where I stand.

177
00:32:01.601 --> 00:32:40.400
I do not favour a peacetime draft or registration but but I do favour pay and benefit levels that will attract and keep highly motivated men and women in our volunteer forces and and back them up with an active reserve, trained and ready for instant call in case of emergency.

178
00:32:41.801 --> 00:32:50.100
You know there may be a sailor at the helm of the ship of state, but the ship has no rudder.

179
00:32:52.301 --> 00:32:58.600
Critical, Critical decisions are made, at times almost in comic fashion.

180
00:32:58.801 --> 00:32:59.800
But who can laugh?

181
00:33:00.401 --> 00:33:20.800
Who was not embarrassed when the administration handed a major propaganda victory in the United Nations to the enemies of Israel, our staunch Middle East ally, for three decades, and then claimed that the American vote was a mistake, the result of a failure of communication between the president, his Secretary of State, and his UN ambassador?

182
00:33:21.601 --> 00:33:37.900
Who does not feel a growing sense of unease as our allies, facing repeated instances of an amateuration can and confused administration, reluctantly conclude that America is unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations as leader of the free world?

183
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:46.200
Who does not feel rising alarm when the question and any discussion of foreign policy is no longer Should we do something?

184
00:33:46.801 --> 00:33:50.000
But do we have the capacity to do anything?

185
00:33:58.801 --> 00:34:08.600
The administration which has brought us to this state is seeking your endorsement for four more years of weakness, indecision, mediocrity and incompetence.

186
00:34:09.401 --> 00:34:16.199
No, no, no American should vote until he or she has asked.

187
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:21.900
Is the United States stronger and more respected now than it was 3 1/2 years ago?

188
00:34:24.301 --> 00:34:27.800
Is the world safer, a safer place in which to live?

189
00:34:28.601 --> 00:34:41.600
It is the reason it is the responsibility of the President of the United States in working for peace to ensure that the safety of our people cannot successfully be threatened by a hostile foreign power.

190
00:34:42.401 --> 00:34:48.300
As President, fulfilling that responsibility will be my number one priority.

191
00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.000
We're not a war like people.

192
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:06.700
Quite the opposite.

193
00:35:07.501 --> 00:35:09.400
We always seek to live in peace.

194
00:35:09.901 --> 00:35:17.000
We resort to force infrequently and with great reluctance, and only after we've determined that it's absolutely necessary.

195
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:23.800
We are awed, and rightly so, by the forces of destruction that loosen the world in its nuclear era.

196
00:35:25.001 --> 00:35:27.300
But neither can we be naive or foolish.

197
00:35:28.301 --> 00:35:42.300
4 times in my lifetime America has gone to war, bleeding the lives of its young men into the sands of island beachheads, the fields of Europe, and the jungles and rice paddies of Asia.

198
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:50.100
We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, it is when they are weak.

199
00:35:50.601 --> 00:35:52.000
The tyrants are tempted.

200
00:35:52.501 --> 00:36:26.100
We simply cannot learn these lessons the hard way again without risking our destruction of of all of all of all the objectives we seek.

201
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:31.900
First and foremost is the establishment of lasting World Peace.

202
00:36:32.601 --> 00:36:38.500
We must always stand ready to negotiate in good faith, ready to pursue any reasonable Ave.

203
00:36:38.501 --> 00:36:43.300
that holds forth the promise of lessening tensions and furthering the prospects of peace.

204
00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:47.400
But let our friends and those who may wish us.

205
00:36:47.401 --> 00:36:48.400
I'll take note.

206
00:36:49.301 --> 00:37:01.800
The United States has an obligation to its citizens and to the people of the world never to let those who would destroy freedom dictate the future course of life on this planet.

207
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:25.800
I would regard, I would regard my election as proof that we have renewed our resolve to preserve World Peace and freedom, that this nation will once again be strong enough to do that.

208
00:37:27.201 --> 00:37:43.100
Now, this evening, this evening marks the last steps save one of a campaign that has taken Nancy and me from one end of this great nation to the other over many months and thousands and thousands of miles.

209
00:37:43.901 --> 00:37:53.100
There are those who question the way we choose a president, who say that our process imposes difficult and exhausting burdens on those who seek the office.

210
00:37:54.201 --> 00:37:55.200
I have not found it.

211
00:37:55.201 --> 00:37:57.700
So it is.

212
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:02.600
It is.

213
00:38:04.401 --> 00:38:13.000
It's impossible to capture in words the splendor of this vast continent, which God has granted as our portion of His creation.

214
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:26.900
There are no words to express the extraordinary strength and character of this breed of people we call American everywhere, Everywhere.

215
00:38:26.901 --> 00:38:41.400
We've met thousands of Democrats, independents and Republicans from all economic conditions, all walks of life, bound together in that community of shared values of family, work, neighborhood, peace and freedom.

216
00:38:42.001 --> 00:38:43.600
They are concerned, yes.

217
00:38:44.101 --> 00:38:45.000
They're not frightened.

218
00:38:45.801 --> 00:38:48.200
They're disturbed, but not dismayed.

219
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:57.100
They are the kind of men and women Tom Paine had in mind when he wrote during the darkest days of the American Revolution.

220
00:38:58.201 --> 00:39:03.000
We have it in our power to begin the world over again.

221
00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:26.700
Nearly nearly 150 years after Tom Paine wrote those words, an American president told the generation of the Great Depression that it had a rendezvous with destiny.

222
00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:36.300
I believe this generation of Americans today also has a rendezvous with destiny tonight.

223
00:39:40.401 --> 00:39:45.100
Tonight, let us dedicate ourselves to renewing the American compact.

224
00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:55.700
I ask you not simply to trust me, but to trust your values, our values, and to hold me responsible for living up to them.

225
00:39:56.501 --> 00:40:05.900
I ask you to trust that American spirit, which knows no ethnic, religious, social, political, regional or economic boundaries.

226
00:40:06.501 --> 00:40:13.100
The spirit that burned with zeal in the hearts of millions of immigrants from every corner of the earth who came here in search of freedom.

227
00:40:14.001 --> 00:40:17.800
Some say that spirit no longer exists, but I've seen it.

228
00:40:18.501 --> 00:40:25.000
I felt it all across this land, in the big cities, the small towns, and in rural America.

229
00:40:25.401 --> 00:40:32.600
It's still there, ready to blaze into life if you and I are willing to do what has to be done.

230
00:40:42.001 --> 00:40:52.500
We we have to do the practical things, the down to earth things such as creating policies that will stimulate our economy, increase productivity, and put America back to work.

231
00:40:53.201 --> 00:41:02.100
The time is now to limit federal spending, to insist on a stable monetary reform, and to free ourselves from imported oil.

232
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:03.600
The time.

233
00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:26.400
The time is now to resolve that the basis of a firm and principled foreign policy is one that takes the world as it is and seeks to change it by leadership and example, not by harangue, harassment or wishful thinking.

234
00:41:27.301 --> 00:41:29.000
The time now is now.

235
00:41:32.101 --> 00:41:45.100
The time is now to say that we shall seek new friendships and expand others and improve others, but we shall not do so by breaking our word or casting aside old friends and allies.

236
00:41:55.001 --> 00:42:07.500
And the time is now to redeem promises once made to the American people by another candidate in another time and another place, he said.

237
00:42:08.701 --> 00:42:17.200
For three long years I have been going up and down this country preaching that government, Federal, state and local cost too much.

238
00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:22.000
I shall not stop that preaching as an immediate program of action.

239
00:42:22.001 --> 00:42:24.900
We must abolish useful, useless offices.

240
00:42:25.201 --> 00:42:28.400
We must eliminate unnecessary functions of government.

241
00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:37.100
We must consolidate subdivisions of government and like the private citizen, give up luxuries which we can no longer afford.

242
00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:51.400
And then he said, I propose to you, my friends, and through you, that government of all kinds, big and little, be made solvent, and that the example be set by the president of the United States and his cabinet.

243
00:42:52.001 --> 00:42:52.800
End of quote.

244
00:42:54.701 --> 00:43:02.600
That was Franklin Delano Roosevelt's words as he accepted the Democratic nomination for president in 1932.

245
00:43:03.701 --> 00:43:13.200
The time, the time is now, my fellow Americans, to recapture our destiny, to take it into our own hands.

246
00:43:14.101 --> 00:43:19.100
And to do this will take away many of us or will take many of us working together.

247
00:43:19.601 --> 00:43:28.500
I ask you tonight all over this land to volunteer your help in this cause so that we can carry our message throughout the land.

248
00:43:29.801 --> 00:43:48.400
Isn't it time that we the people carry out those unkept promises that we pledge to each other and to all America on this July day, 48 years later, that now we intend to do just that?

249
00:44:00.701 --> 00:44:11.600
I I have, I have thought of something that's not a part of my speech and worried over whether I should do it.

250
00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:20.700
Can we doubt that only a divine Providence placed this land, this island of freedom?

251
00:44:21.301 --> 00:44:26.000
Here is a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe free.

252
00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:31.400
Jews and Christians enduring persecution behind the Iron Curtain.

253
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:35.800
The boat people of Southeast Asia, of Cuba and of Haiti.

254
00:44:37.001 --> 00:44:45.500
The victims of drought and famine in Africa, the freedom fighters in Afghanistan, and our own countrymen held in savage captivity.

255
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:53.100
I'll confess that I've been a little afraid to suggest what I'm going to suggest.

256
00:44:56.401 --> 00:44:58.000
I'm more afraid not to.

257
00:45:00.001 --> 00:45:01.800
Can we begin our crusade?

258
00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:06.500
Join together in a moment of silent prayer.

259
00:45:19.701 --> 00:45:21.000
God Bless America.

260
00:45:22.301 --> 00:45:22.700
Thank you.
