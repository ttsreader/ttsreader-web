Hi, thanks for joining us.

2
00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.700
I'm Ronan, Speech Notes Head developer.

3
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:14.100
In this short video, I will demo you how to use Speech Notes files to transcribe any audio or video file local on your device or online.

4
00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's start.

5
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:25.000
OK, so once you're logged into Speech Notes files, you'll start by adding credit, meaning you purchase minutes.

6
00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:33.200
The flat rate is only $0.10 a minute and on your first purchase you get 10% more.

7
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:42.800
Any spare minutes that you don't use remain on your account so you can use them the next time.

8
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:43.700
So it's so it's really you.

9
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:52.600
You buy packages, so let's start by buying 120 minutes, meaning two hours, and we get 12 minutes for free.

10
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:56.800
OK, so we have our credits in place.

11
00:00:56.801 --> 00:01:12.000
We can upload our our first file so we will select the local file, but we could also just paste the link to an online file or a Google Drive file or even a YouTube.

12
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:28.500
But we'll upload a test file from our computer and we have short demo recording language.

13
00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:30.600
There are multiple languages available.

14
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:38.100
We'll select US, English and only one speaker, Next, next and upload.

15
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:42.700
And really that's all you have to do from now on.

16
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.300
Once the file is uploaded, it's on our servers.

17
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:49.600
You can even leave the website, close your device.

18
00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.300
We will notify you when the file is ready.

19
00:01:53.701 --> 00:02:00.400
If you do stay on page, you will see here the progress of the job of the file.

20
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:07.000
And our file was very short, so it was already done in a few seconds.

21
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:13.300
We can open it and view the transcription results you see it is timestamped.

22
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:20.900
You can also export it to different formats, with speaker tags or without, with timestamps or without.

23
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.200
Print it if you like.

24
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.700
And you can also play it In Sync with the recording.

25
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:30.400
Let's do that so you see how it looks.

26
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:34.900
Hi, how are you?

27
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:42.800
This is a sample recording to show how easy and fast it is to transcribe audio files with speech notes.

28
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:47.100
Right.

29
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:47.400
So.

30
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.500
So you saw it's pretty accurate, even though I have a quite a thick accent.

31
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:56.400
So yeah, that's that's really it.

32
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:02.700
If you need any help or have feedback or recommendations, anything, just let me know.

33
00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:07.400
My personal mission is to make speech notes as it's written here.

34
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:13.600
Secure, private, affordable, and the most accurate speech recognition service available.

35
00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:19.200
You can e-mail us or use the chat option on speech, notes files.
