00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:09.400
Hi, can you hear me?

2
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.200
I can.

3
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.000
Can you hear me so?

4
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.000
Tell me why you're interested in the job in the ICU here.

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:27.800
So I, when I, I'm from Arizona State, I graduated from Arizona State University and I did some clinicals at hospitals and I also volunteered at going through nursing school.

6
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:37.600
But so I love, but the reason why I love ICU is I really love the ICU atmosphere.

7
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.300
I love the critical thinking.

8
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:47.400
I like the, you know, sort of fast, fast pace at times where, you know, you're really having to use your nursing judgment.

9
00:00:47.801 --> 00:01:00.400
And I think that a lot of ICU nurses have a similar personality, which I feel like I kind of blend in, you know, kind of that very detail oriented, you know, in depth thinking, which really appeals to my interests.

10
00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:12.000
So that's why I, I see you appeals to me and then just feels in general appeal to me because I had experiences, you know, volunteering there and my clinical's there and it's always been great have.

11
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:15.400
You been working as a nurse up in Washington?

12
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.000
Yes, yeah.

13
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:18.800
OK, but why don't you tell me about that?

14
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.000
What are you doing up there?

15
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:33.500
So I am working at a hospital it's called and I am my main position is actually on a medical surgical floor, but it's a very rural hospital.

16
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:37.500
And so I have been cross trained into our ICU and ER.

17
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:47.400
So actually most of the time I show up to my Med surg position and they say, oh, we're short a nurse in the ER or you know, we have a high patient load in the ICU today or difficult patients.

18
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:51.600
And so we need you there or you're down a nurse in the ICU and we can put you there.

19
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:54.800
And so most of the time I actually end up not being on Med surg.

20
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:57.200
So I'm cross trained to all of the spots.

21
00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:58.600
So it's a very rural hospital.

22
00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.500
It has an ER, it has a small OR.

23
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.900
The ICU is a total of 6 beds and they have two nurses there.

24
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:10.500
And our Med surg is about 25 beds or so very tiny.

25
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:21.900
But it's been great because I get to be resourceful and I feel like I have a good contribution to the hospital because they can, I never get called off because they can always put me somewhere, which is good.

26
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:22.000
That's.

27
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:26.000
Good and rural hospitals and bricks.

28
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:27.600
You have to learn everything.

29
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:28.300
Yes.

30
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:30.300
Coming down.

31
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:39.400
The Wall Street there, yes, it was a huge shocker coming from, you know, ASU had such a great well-rounded nursing program with all the clinical sites, these huge hospitals.

32
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:42.500
And I come here, this is the only hospital I'm on actually an island.

33
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:48.200
It's the only hospital on the island and we still do paper orders.

34
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:51.100
We're slowly, we're transitioning into not doing paper orders.

35
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:52.600
And I was like, what is this?

36
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:59.600
You know, I had to learn so many things that I didn't realize I was going to actually have to know being in a rural hospital.

37
00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:06.200
But it's been good and it's been nice to have the different aspect and approach to things compared to where I did my clinicals from.

38
00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:06.600
So how?

39
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.500
Long have you been working at the hospital there?

40
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.900
I have been there since beginning of September.

41
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:12.300
I got my license in August.

42
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:14.900
So closely creeping up on a year.

43
00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:15.300
Tell me what?

44
00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:20.400
Kind of orientation did you get when you started nursing there?

45
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:29.200
When I started nursing, I being a small hospital, they don't have a set orientation program or preceptorship program.

46
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:38.800
So I had like a three day little clinical orientation as far as learning certain kind of equipment in the pumps and things like that and going kind of through policies.

47
00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:44.500
And then I was paired with another nurse for a about 3 weeks.

48
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.400
So it was not a very extensive amount of time.

49
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:51.200
My orientation to the ICU and ER have been longer.

50
00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:57.700
I was paired with a nurse in the ER for about 2-3 months and same for the ICU.

51
00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:01.600
And but I'm also picking up shifts over there.

52
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:04.800
So I'm not there consistently, you know, 3-4 times a week.

53
00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:09.500
So that's why, you know, it's been a little longer of a stretch, but right, Right.

54
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:11.200
OK, cool.

55
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:11.900
All right.

56
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:12.300
Very nice.

57
00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:15.600
What would you say is your five year goal?

58
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:24.100
My five year goal right now, I would love to I'm starting to think about what I want to do to expand my education.

59
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:31.200
I'm really still, you know, getting my feet wet and, you know, learning what nursing is all about in the different fields and everything.

60
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:43.200
But I would ideally I see myself in five years have beginning or you know, in halfway in or whatever to getting my masters or I've also thought about nurse practitioner.

61
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:49.200
But again, I'm just right now trying to kind of figure out what I want to do before I actually go in and specialize in something.

62
00:04:50.301 --> 00:04:52.100
What strength do you bring to this role?

63
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:59.700
I think my strengths are one, I'm very outgoing, I get along great with others.

64
00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:12.100
I feel like I have a lot of knowledge to offer and you know, if I in critical thinking and if I don't know something, I am going to figure it out and or ask people to figure out the answer.

65
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:14.000
I'm not afraid to ask questions.

66
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:17.600
I'm not shy of, you know, being open about what I don't know.

67
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:28.500
And I feel like I'm a great communicator, whether it's communicating with my fellow nursing staff or the charge nurse or the managers or supervisors or the physicians.

68
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:38.300
I'm not as scared to approach and ask those questions, especially when it involves patient care because I never want to compromise that.

69
00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:41.600
And so yeah, those are some of my strengths.

70
00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:41.600
How?

71
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:44.500
Have you been keeping your knowledge current?

72
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:59.300
So, well, one thing I do every day I have, I don't think there's a single shift I have gone by that I have not looked something up, but I've been, they have little classes that are offered at my hospital that I do like.

73
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:00.100
I did one recently.

74
00:06:00.101 --> 00:06:03.100
It was like a geriatric education course.

75
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:06.400
I, I've got my BLS in ACLS.

76
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:13.600
I just finished a telemetry course in April that was like a nine week extensive like in depth course of telemetry.

77
00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:18.400
And pretty much I feel like at all times I've been doing some sort of course.

78
00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:25.900
When I started in ICU, I had to complete an ICU consortium class that was like 64 CE US and it was online.

79
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:28.200
And so I did that too.

80
00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:41.200
It's basically kind of like, well, it's very in depth, but an intro to ICU, even though it was very detailed oriented, but it was a good exposure to the information before I was actually, you know, seeing it in in person.

81
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:41.300
How?

82
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.400
Do you show people you're listening?

83
00:06:44.601 --> 00:07:00.000
To them eye contact and also so eye contact looking at them and then kind of regurgitating what they're saying and making sure that I'm understanding them correctly and I'm just being engaged.

84
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:08.300
And I think, I mean, we know listening is a huge part of being a nurse and that's pretty much, you know, a big part of our job.

85
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:12.500
But yeah, regurgitating what they say to make sure that I'm.

86
00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:27.600
I'm hearing them correctly and even if I have no idea what to say, if it's like a sad situation or terrible situation, I feel like if you just regurgitator like I see, I see that you're feeling distraught or I see that you're feeling frustrated.

87
00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:34.000
That tends to work well for listening and the patients or family members or whoever it is as well in.

88
00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:40.600
Your hospital, are there any process improvement projects going on for anything in particular?

89
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:46.700
So on the falls committee, what sort of things are they trying to implement to help reduce falls?

90
00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:51.800
Tell me about a time you had to go above and beyond the Call of Duty to get something done.

91
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:52.500
What was that?

92
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.800
What kinds of challenges do you face on your current job?

93
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:09.600
Current job the challenges would be equipment that is older and not quite working as well can be kind of frustrating.

94
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:25.400
And recently we, I actually had a, a patient who was went downhill very quickly on Med surg and the blood pressure machine stopped working and the bed stopped working and we have double rooms.

95
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:29.600
And so we had to literally like pick up the bed.

96
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:31.600
We had a bunch of us to try and turn it.

97
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:40.100
And so I think one of the most challenging things is sometimes feeling like you don't have the resources there that you need to provide the best patient care.

98
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:45.700
And obviously that's something that they're forever working on, especially with not having as many resources.

99
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:55.300
But it's frustrating from a nursing standpoint when you think back and say, you know, I wish this would have worked or I could have done this differently, or if I had this, this would have gone better.

100
00:08:55.301 --> 00:09:02.400
But I mean, that's one of the great parts about nursing as you always forever are learning from those mistakes or things that didn't go well.

101
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.300
And you can better improve for the next situation.

102
00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:06.900
OK.

103
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:12.000
What do you think is the most important aspect of great customer service?

104
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:15.100
Most important, great customer service.

105
00:09:15.101 --> 00:09:25.700
Well would be the making the patient or a person, whoever you're feeling, feeling like you are like almost like they're the only one there that you are going above and beyond for them.

106
00:09:25.701 --> 00:09:41.000
And you know, even if you walk into one room and you have a patient who is totally not doing well or angry at you or angry at the doctor is being able to walk into the next room and making that patient feel like you didn't just get yelled at.

107
00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:46.100
You are there to be available to them and that you are there to meet their needs.

108
00:09:46.501 --> 00:10:04.000
And no matter how what lengths that you have to go to, to, to serve them and make them feel like their stay is, you know, going to the best that they can, because no one comes to the hospital for fun, ideally, except in the ER.

109
00:10:04.001 --> 00:10:07.300
I feel like some people come to the ER for fun.

110
00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:14.600
It's like their hobby, but you know, no one's in the hospital for, you know, they're in their most vulnerable states.

111
00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:19.300
And I think that's one of the things I love about being a nurse is you're working with them in the most vulnerable states.

112
00:10:19.301 --> 00:10:24.800
So making sure that they feel like you are there for them, whether it's listening or making them just feel better.

113
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:25.200
But right tell.

114
00:10:26.201 --> 00:10:29.800
Me about, well, I know you told me about the work guy.

115
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:38.300
Can you tell me about another difficult patients or a family member that you had to take care of and how you turned around the situation?

116
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:51.000
Yeah, so I had a family one time that was, they didn't like the hospitalist that was assigned to their father's case.

117
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:56.900
They had had this hospitalist before several times, and they did not really, they weren't very fond of her.

118
00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:07.500
And you know, as a nurse, you, I was, you know, it's hard 'cause even though I really like this hospitalist, you can't be like, oh, no, they're wonderful, it's fine, 'cause I was validating.

119
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:09.800
I had to validate, you know, their concerns.

120
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:13.400
You know, I, I'm sorry you had this bad experience.

121
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:25.700
And whenever I have a family member who's upset, whether it's at a previous, maybe a previous nurse or previous physician, I always like to say, what can I do for you right now that can would help the situation?

122
00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:26.500
What do you think?

123
00:11:26.801 --> 00:11:30.400
What can I do within my power where we could solve this?

124
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:34.000
This family member in particular, they're very upset.

125
00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:37.500
And I said, you know what, I will, I'll see what I can do.

126
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:44.500
I will talk with the hospitals and, and let them know your concerns and see what we can arrange.

127
00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:47.600
And they actually ended up switching the to a different hospital.

128
00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:48.900
So there's always 2 on.

129
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:57.100
And so they were very thankful by the time they went home, they felt like their dad was in better care, even though this other hospitals does a phenomenal job.

130
00:11:57.201 --> 00:11:59.800
They must have just not lined up at some point.

131
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:02.400
And they are very thankful for that.

132
00:12:02.401 --> 00:12:08.500
And it, you know, kind of put out a little fire that could have been bad at the start of my shift.

133
00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:13.300
Probably about a time when somebody challenged your trustworthiness.

134
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.700
How did you handle that?

135
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.600
I did have.

136
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.800
So I mean, this kind of goes along with it.

137
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:27.900
I'm trying to think of a good situation, but I did have a nurse who well, it was I so I work kind of a mid shift right now.

138
00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:30.300
I work from 3:00 PM to 11:30 PM.

139
00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:43.600
And so this night shift nurse was coming on at 111130 and we were given a report and she notoriously liked to call me out on things in the patient's room that maybe I hadn't done that I should have done.

140
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:50.900
And I was just, you know, I was learning at the time I was very new and so I didn't, wasn't aware of certain protocols yet without things were done.

141
00:12:50.901 --> 00:13:01.600
And so this nurse had called one time this patient was in for a fall and they were, I think they, no, I don't think they fractured their hip.

142
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:04.900
I think they were in for a, a syncopal fall.

143
00:13:05.001 --> 00:13:11.600
And so we were monitoring them and this patient was totally alert and oriented, would call appropriately every time they need to get to the bathroom.

144
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:16.000
And so all the bed alarm was not on the patient because they were calling appropriately.

145
00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:23.700
But for our hospital policy, if a patient is in for a fall, they are to have the bed alarm on.

146
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:46.900
And so this nurse made me aware of that and in the patient's room during report, which wasn't very professional on her end, but I ended up afterwards, after the situation had passed, I ended up, you know, later on at the end of report, not in the patient's room, just saying, hey, if there's ever an issue with, you know, maybe I haven't done something correct, you know, I, I apologize, I, I am still learning.

147
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:49.400
But if, you know, you can let me know outside of the room.

148
00:13:49.401 --> 00:13:54.400
That way we can talk about it and, you know, figure it out in a professional, respectful way.

149
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:56.900
That way the, the patient doesn't feel involved.

150
00:13:56.901 --> 00:14:01.600
And at first she was a little taken back, but you know, now we're good, we're great.

151
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:04.000
No issues have arised.

152
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:08.600
And, you know, sometimes it just, we all need a little reminder sometimes and we, you know, sure.

153
00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:08.900
Sure.

154
00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:09.400
Good.

155
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:09.500
OK.

156
00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:12.800
How did your Co workers describe you?

157
00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:21.800
Very outgoing, energetic, a quick learner.

158
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:31.600
I've had a lot of nurses on my shift saying, wow, you know, you've only been a nurse for this long and you've already, you know, surpassed this nurse who's been a nurse for 10 years.

159
00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:41.300
Or, you know, they not that it's good to compare, but they always are saying how they're like, wow, you do so much, you know, you're in the ER and the ICU and you're so new, like, how do you do it all?

160
00:14:41.701 --> 00:14:50.700
And I think they describe me as a a quick learner, someone who's very focused and motivated and yeah, OK.

161
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:55.200
Call bye what's important to you in your work environment.

162
00:14:56.701 --> 00:15:02.300
Important in my work environment is that I like who I work with and I like what I'm doing.

163
00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:17.100
I think that even if you have a terrible shift, if you have a great support system and team to get you through that, that makes you know world of a difference and you can still come home and feel supported.

164
00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:32.100
I also think having a great upper management with who you can talk to if you feel like a situation is incorrect where you feel like if you talk to them, they're not going to go and disclose your name to other supervisors or things like that.

165
00:15:32.401 --> 00:15:37.000
You know, when they're talking with them is important.

166
00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:38.100
And I'm fortunate.

167
00:15:38.101 --> 00:15:54.400
I do feel like I have a good management where I'm at right now and I, you know, have utilized that where I've talked to my manager quite a bit and also she's been very open to me cross training, which is difficult for some managers to have an employee that they are now donating to other departments.

168
00:15:54.401 --> 00:15:59.200
But yeah, having a great when you have a supportive upper management is I think huge.

169
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:01.400
Yeah, good, good.

170
00:16:01.501 --> 00:16:02.100
What are your?

171
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:12.000
Expectations about expectations is that I have a great team with who I can go to for questions.

172
00:16:12.701 --> 00:16:33.600
I also would love continuing education opportunities and you know things that classes or you know, we're finding able to find resources for ways to expand my education and I just mainly going back to feeling supported in all aspects of you know, I'm.

173
00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:35.100
We're all still learning.

174
00:16:35.101 --> 00:16:39.800
Doesn't matter if you've been a nurse for 25 years, you know, every day still learning.

175
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:43.700
So yeah, feeling supported, like I have a good a good team, sure.

176
00:16:44.801 --> 00:16:45.300
Very good.

177
00:16:45.601 --> 00:16:46.700
OK, well, I'm done.

178
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:47.400
My question.

179
00:16:48.001 --> 00:16:50.400
So let me tell you about the ICU's, OK?

180
00:16:50.701 --> 00:16:51.000
OK all.

181
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:51.600
