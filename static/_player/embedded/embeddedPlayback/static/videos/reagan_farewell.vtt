1
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:31.700
9876543 Two My fellow Americans, this is the 34th time I'll speak to you from the Oval Office and the last.

2
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:35.600
We've been together 8 years now, and soon it'll be time for me to go.

3
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:41.400
But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a long time.

4
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:44.700
It's been the honor of my life to be your president.

5
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:50.000
So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could say as much to you.

6
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.400
Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serve.

7
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:59.400
One of the things about the presidency is that you're always somewhat apart.

8
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.600
You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car.

9
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:11.300
Someone else is driving and seeing the people through tinted glass, the parents holding up a child and the wave you saw too late and couldn't return.

10
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.900
And so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass and connect.

11
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:19.800
Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.

12
00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:22.600
People ask how I feel about leaving.

13
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.800
And the fact is, parting is such sweet sorrow.

14
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.700
The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom.

15
00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:42.900
The sorrow, the goodbyes, of course, and leaving this beautiful place, you know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of the White House where the president and his family live.

16
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:48.600
There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of.

17
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:56.300
Early in the morning, the view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument and then the Mall and the Jefferson Memorial.

18
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:04.000
But on mornings when the humidity is low, you can see past the Jefferson to the river, the Potomac and the Virginia shore.

19
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:09.400
Someone said that's the view Lincoln had when he saw the smoke rising from the Battle of Bull Run.

20
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:12.400
Well, I see more prosaic things.

21
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:16.700
The grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work.

22
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:19.000
Now and then a sailboat on the river.

23
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:21.500
I've been thinking a bit at that window.

24
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:25.900
I've been reflecting on what the past eight years have meant and mean.

25
00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:35.300
And the image that comes to mind, like a refrain, is a nautical 1A small story about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor.

26
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:44.400
It was back in the early 80s at the height of the boat people, and the sailor was hard at work on the carrier Midway, which was patrolling the South China Sea.

27
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:50.200
The sailor, like most American servicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant.

28
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:58.600
The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat, and crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America.

29
00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:02.600
The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety.

30
00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:10.100
As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, 1 spied the sailor on deck and stood up and called out to him.

31
00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.900
He yelled, Hello, American sailor, Hello, freedom, man.

32
00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.800
A small moment with a big meaning.

33
00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:18.700
A moment.

34
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.000
The sailor who wrote it in the letter couldn't get out of his mind.

35
00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:24.700
And when I saw it, neither could I.

36
00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:26.800
Because that's what it has to.

37
00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:28.600
It was to be an American.

38
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.800
In the 1980s, we stood again for freedom.

39
00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:33.600
I know we always have.

40
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:36.200
But in the past few years, the world again.

41
00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:39.400
And in a way, we ourselves rediscovered it.

42
00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:49.400
It's been quite a journey this decade, and we held together through some stormy seas, and at the end, together, we're reaching our destination.

43
00:03:50.301 --> 00:04:02.400
The fact is, from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits, from the recession of 81 to 82 to the expansion that began in late 82 and continues to this day, we've made a difference.

44
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:07.700
The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that I'm proudest of.

45
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:16.600
One is the economic recovery in which the people of America created and filled 19,000,000 new jobs.

46
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.300
The other is the recovery of our morale.

47
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:23.900
America is respected again in the world and look to for leadership.

48
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.900
Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this.

49
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:35.400
It was back in 1981 and I was attending my first big economic summit, which was held that year in Canada.

50
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:38.800
The meeting place rotates among the member countries.

51
00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:44.100
The opening meeting was a formal dinner for the Heads of Government of the seven industrialized nations.

52
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:51.400
Well, I sat there like the new kid in school and listened, and it was all Francois this and Helmut that.

53
00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:56.300
They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a first name basis.

54
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:02.200
But at one point I sort of leaned in and said, my name's Ron.

55
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:14.200
But in that same year, we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback, Cut taxes and regulation, started to cut spending, and soon the recovery began.

56
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:18.700
2 years later, another economic summit with pretty much the same cast.

57
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:27.000
At the big opening meeting, we all got together and all of a sudden and just for a moment, I saw that everyone was just sitting there looking at me.

58
00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:29.600
And then one of them broke the silence.

59
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:33.900
Tell us about the American Miracle, he said.

60
00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:39.200
Well, back in 1980 when I was running for president, it was all so different.

61
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:46.000
Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe, our views on foreign affairs would cause war.

62
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:51.300
Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse.

63
00:05:52.301 --> 00:06:07.200
I even remember 1 highly respected economist saying back in 1982 that the engines of economic growth have shut down here and they're likely to stay that way for years to come.

64
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:15.100
While he and the other opinion leaders were wrong, the fact is what they called radical was really right.

65
00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:18.900
What they called dangerous was just desperately needed.

66
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:29.400
And in all of that time, I won a nickname, The Great Communicator, but I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference.

67
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:31.200
It was the content.

68
00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:38.800
I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn't spring full bloom from my brow.

69
00:06:39.401 --> 00:06:48.100
They came from the heart of a great nation, from our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries.

70
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:50.800
They called it the Reagan Revolution.

71
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:52.100
Well, I'll accept that.

72
00:06:52.601 --> 00:07:00.000
But for me, it always seemed more like the great rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common sense.

73
00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:06.300
Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce less of it.

74
00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:11.500
So we cut the people's tax rates, and the people produced more than ever before.

75
00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:17.300
The economy bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger.

76
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:22.400
Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our history.

77
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:31.300
Real family income up, the poverty rate down, entrepreneurship booming, and an explosion in research and new technology.

78
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:36.700
We're exporting more now than ever because American industry became more competitive.

79
00:07:37.201 --> 00:07:45.800
And at the same time, we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls abroad instead of erecting them at home.

80
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:54.700
Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace, we'd have to become strong again after years of weakness and confusion.

81
00:07:55.201 --> 00:08:01.800
So we rebuild our defenses, and this new year we toasted the new peacefulness around the globe.

82
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:14.800
Not only have the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and hope for even more progress is bright, but the regional conflicts that Wrack the globe are also beginning to cease.

83
00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:17.700
The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone.

84
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:20.200
The Soviets are leaving Afghanistan.

85
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:30.700
The Vietnamese are preparing to pull out of Cambodia, and an American mediated accord will soon send 50,000 Cuban troops home from Angola.

86
00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:37.799
The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we're a great nation, our challenges seem complex.

87
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:47.200
It will always be this way, but as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours.

88
00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:53.800
And something else we learned Once you begin a great movement, there's no telling where it'll end.

89
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:59.000
We meant to change a nation, and instead we changed a world.

90
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:06.400
Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past.

91
00:09:07.001 --> 00:09:15.800
For them, the great rediscovery of the 1980s has been that, lo and behold, the moral way of government is the practical way of government.

92
00:09:16.401 --> 00:09:20.800
Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive.

93
00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:31.400
When you've got to the point where you can celebrate the anniversaries of your 39th birthday, you can sit back, sometimes review your life and see it flowing before you.

94
00:09:32.201 --> 00:09:36.500
For me, there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life.

95
00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:46.300
I never meant to go into politics, wasn't my intention when I was young, but I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings bestowed on you.

96
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:55.400
I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious.

97
00:09:56.301 --> 00:10:02.200
Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government.

98
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:06.600
And with three little words, We the people.

99
00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:10.400
We the people tell the government what to do.

100
00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:12.000
It doesn't tell us.

101
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:14.100
We the people are the driver.

102
00:10:14.501 --> 00:10:20.400
The government is the car, and we decide where it should go and by what route and how fast.

103
00:10:21.101 --> 00:10:27.600
Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are.

104
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:35.600
Our constitution is a document in which we the people tell the government what it is allowed to do.

105
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:38.500
We the people are free.

106
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:44.200
This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I've tried to do these past eight years.

107
00:10:45.001 --> 00:11:02.000
But back in the 1960s, when I began, it seemed to me that we'd begun reversing the order of things, that through more and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes, the government was taking more of our money, more of our options, and more of our freedom.

108
00:11:03.401 --> 00:11:07.900
I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say stop.

109
00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:12.600
I was a citizen politician, and it seemed the right thing for a citizen to do.

110
00:11:13.601 --> 00:11:23.900
I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping, and I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited.

111
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:29.300
There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics.

112
00:11:29.801 --> 00:11:33.700
As government expands, liberty contracts.

113
00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:36.900
Nothing is less free than pure communism.

114
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:42.900
And yet we have, the past few years, forged a satisfying new closeness with the Soviet Union.

115
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:51.700
I've been asked if this isn't a gamble, and my answer is no, because we're basing our actions not on words but deeds.

116
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:56.700
The detente of this 1970s was based not on actions but promises.

117
00:11:57.201 --> 00:12:00.300
They'd promised to treat their own people and the people of the world better.

118
00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:10.500
But the gulag was still the gulag, and the state was still expansionist, and they still waged proxy wars in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

119
00:12:11.401 --> 00:12:13.600
Well, this time so far, it's different.

120
00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:21.100
President Gorbachev has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

121
00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:26.000
He has also freed prisoners whose names I've given him every time we've met.

122
00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:30.900
But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents.

123
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:40.900
Once, during the heady days of the Moscow summit, Nancy and I decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit the shops on Arbat St.

124
00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:42.100
That's a little St.

125
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:44.500
just off Moscow's main shopping area.

126
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:53.200
Even though our visit was a surprise, every Russian there immediately recognized us and called out our names and reached for our hands.

127
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:55.800
We were just about swept away by the warmth.

128
00:12:56.301 --> 00:12:59.200
You could almost feel the possibilities and all that joy.

129
00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:07.200
But within seconds, AK GB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd.

130
00:13:08.001 --> 00:13:09.200
It was an interesting moment.

131
00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:19.200
It reminded me that while a man in the street in the Soviet Union yearns for peace, the government is communist and those who run it are communists.

132
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:26.300
And that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human rights very differently.

133
00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:35.100
We must keep up our guard, but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust.

134
00:13:36.201 --> 00:13:40.400
My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous Soviet leaders.

135
00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:45.000
I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them.

136
00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:54.600
We wish him well, and we'll continue to work to make sure that the Soviet Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one.

137
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.400
What it all boils down to is this.

138
00:13:58.201 --> 00:14:06.400
I want the new closeness to continue, and it will as long as we make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way.

139
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:09.600
As long as they continue to act in a helpful manner.

140
00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:14.100
If and when they don't at first, pull your punches.

141
00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:16.900
If they persist, pull the plug.

142
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:20.400
It's still trust but verify.

143
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:23.500
It's still play, but cut the cards.

144
00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:28.600
It's still watch closely and don't be afraid to see what you see.

145
00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:31.700
I've been asked if I have any regrets.

146
00:14:32.001 --> 00:14:32.900
Well, I do.

147
00:14:33.301 --> 00:14:34.500
The deficit is one.

148
00:14:35.401 --> 00:14:37.600
I've been talking a great deal about that lately.

149
00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:42.900
But tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue, but an observation.

150
00:14:42.901 --> 00:14:51.000
I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything You didn't win for me.

151
00:14:52.001 --> 00:14:53.600
They never saw my troops.

152
00:14:53.801 --> 00:15:02.500
They never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people you won every battle with, every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action.

153
00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:07.200
Well, action is still needed if we're to finish the job.

154
00:15:07.201 --> 00:15:10.300
Reagan's regiments will have to become the Bush brigades.

155
00:15:10.901 --> 00:15:15.400
Soon he'll be the chief, and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.

156
00:15:16.201 --> 00:15:23.700
Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in presidential farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time.

157
00:15:24.601 --> 00:15:34.600
But oddly enough, it starts with one of the things I'm proudest of in the past eight years, the resurgence of national pride that I called the New Patriotism.

158
00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:43.500
This national feeling is good, but it won't count for much and it won't last unless it's grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge.

159
00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:46.800
An informed patriotism is what we want.

160
00:15:47.801 --> 00:15:54.300
And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world?

161
00:15:55.301 --> 00:16:00.700
Those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America.

162
00:16:01.201 --> 00:16:10.600
We were taught very directly what it means to be an American, and we absorbed almost in the air a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions.

163
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:21.000
If you didn't get these things from your family, you got them from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea or the family who lost someone at Anzio.

164
00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:24.500
Or you could get a sense of patriotism from school.

165
00:16:25.301 --> 00:16:30.200
And if all else failed, you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture.

166
00:16:30.801 --> 00:16:37.000
The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special.

167
00:16:37.801 --> 00:16:40.600
TV was like that too, through the mid 60s.

168
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:45.400
But now we're about to enter the 90s, and some things have changed.

169
00:16:46.001 --> 00:16:53.000
Younger parents aren't sure that an unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children.

170
00:16:53.801 --> 00:16:59.600
And As for those who create the popular culture, well grounded patriotism is no longer the style.

171
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:04.700
Our spirit is back, but we haven't reinstitutionalized it.

172
00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:09.300
We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom.

173
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:14.300
Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise.

174
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.000
And freedom is special and rare.

175
00:17:17.701 --> 00:17:18.400
It's fragile.

176
00:17:19.001 --> 00:17:20.099
It needs production.

177
00:17:21.001 --> 00:17:32.800
So we've got to teach history based not on what's in fashion, but what's important, why the pilgrims came here, who Jimmy Doolittle was and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant.

178
00:17:33.701 --> 00:17:43.200
You know, four years ago, on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, I read a letter from a young woman writing to her late father who had fought on Omaha Beach.

179
00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:49.300
Her name was Lisa Zenata Hen, and she said we will always remember.

180
00:17:49.901 --> 00:17:52.600
We will never forget what the boys of Normandy did.

181
00:17:53.801 --> 00:17:56.200
Well, let's help her keep her word.

182
00:17:56.901 --> 00:18:00.800
If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are.

183
00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:09.400
I'm warning of an eradication of that of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the American spirit.

184
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:12.100
Let's start with some basics.

185
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:17.600
More attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual.

186
00:18:18.701 --> 00:18:21.000
And let me offer lesson #1 about America.

187
00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:24.800
All great change in America begins at the dinner table.

188
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:29.200
So tomorrow night in the kitchen, I hope the talking begins.

189
00:18:29.801 --> 00:18:37.400
And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be an American, let them know and nail them on it.

190
00:18:38.301 --> 00:18:40.700
That would be a very American thing to do.

191
00:18:41.801 --> 00:18:45.800
And that's about all I have to say tonight, except for one thing.

192
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:53.100
The past few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the shining City upon a hill.

193
00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:58.400
The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined.

194
00:18:59.001 --> 00:19:03.800
What he imagined was important because he was an early Pilgrim, an early freedom man.

195
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:07.000
He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little wooden boat.

196
00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:12.400
And like the other pilgrims, he was looking for a home that would be free.

197
00:19:13.401 --> 00:19:20.900
I've spoken to the Shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it.

198
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:33.500
But in my mind it was a tall, proud city, built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept God, blessed and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.

199
00:19:34.101 --> 00:19:38.200
A city with pre ports that hummed with commerce and creativity.

200
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:46.700
And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors, and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.

201
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:50.700
That's how I saw it and see it still.

202
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:54.400
And how stands the city on this winter night?

203
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:59.200
More prosperous, more secure and happier than it was eight years ago.

204
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:07.600
But more than that, after 200 years, 2 centuries, she still stands strong and true on the granite Ridge.

205
00:20:08.201 --> 00:20:11.600
And her glow is held steady no matter what storm.

206
00:20:12.401 --> 00:20:13.900
And she's still a beacon.

207
00:20:14.501 --> 00:20:21.900
Still a magnet for all who must have freedom for all the Pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness toward home.

208
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:23.900
We've done our part.

209
00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:36.500
And as I walk off into the city streets, a final word to the men and women of the Reagan Revolution, the men and women across America who for eight years did the work that brought America back.

210
00:20:37.601 --> 00:20:39.100
My friends, we did it.

211
00:20:39.701 --> 00:20:41.300
We weren't just marking time.

212
00:20:41.801 --> 00:20:43.000
We made a difference.

213
00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:50.000
We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands.

214
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:54.600
All in all, not bad, not bad at all.

215
00:20:55.801 --> 00:21:03.700
And so goodbye, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

216
00:21:13.201 --> 00:21:13.300
Good.
