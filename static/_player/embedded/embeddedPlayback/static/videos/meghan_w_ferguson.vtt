00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.000

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.800
Oh, it's a Oh, it's it's a thing.

Yeah.

Yeah.

5
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:11.800
Greg, I love you.

6
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:16.300
It's not something I want to hide from my family.

7
00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:18.200
Jeff.

8
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:19.800
Yeah, I love you.

9
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.400
That is something I want to.

10
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:23.500
Yeah.

11
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:27.100
Please welcome the lovely next bar.

12
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:44.400
Hello Megan.

13
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.200
Wow, you look sensational.

14
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:49.700
Is that one of them swanky designer dresses?

15
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:50.800
I got all dolled up for.

16
00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.500
You, well, it's really working.

17
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.500
You really look well.

18
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:55.700
I mean, well done.

19
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.800
And the show, congratulations, Suits.

20
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:59.300
It's the number one show on TV.

21
00:00:59.401 --> 00:00:59.800
Thank you.

22
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:00.900
I mean, it's crazy.

23
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:01.400
It's like.

24
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:04.700
People have gone crazy for it and I love it because it's got that thing in it.

25
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.100
What thing might that be?

26
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.000
The the suits.

27
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:10.800
Right.

28
00:01:11.301 --> 00:01:12.400
And you're a fan of suits?

29
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:12.600
Yeah, I.

30
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.400
Am I?

31
00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:13.600
I?

32
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:15.400
Well, I wear a lot of suits in my own life.

33
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.600
So I you call a show suits.

34
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:18.400
Do you know that's?

35
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:22.100
A certain fondness you have for it now, just by verge of the name, yes.

36
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:23.200
I've never seen the show.

37
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:23.700
Thank you.

38
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:25.600
What's that about?

39
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:26.200
What's that about?

40
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:32.500
It's basically about this guy who's pretending to be a lawyer he's not really, and how he's making it in this firm.

41
00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:33.800
I am the love interest.

42
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:35.200
Oh, are you a lawyer then?

43
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:36.700
No, I'm a paralegal.

44
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:40.200
Well, that's the same as a lawyer, except you jump out of airplanes, right?

45
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.700
That's it exactly.

46
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.200
No, she's trying to be a lawyer and I hope that she can be that at some point.

47
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.000
But for now, no.

48
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:48.200
The lowly paralegal.

49
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:49.400
What about you?

50
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.800
Have you ever studied law or went to college or Enki?

51
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:53.300
I I did go to college.

52
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:54.800
I went to Northwestern University.

53
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:55.000
That's.

54
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:55.900
The big one.

55
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:59.400
Well hey, thanks my parent my my parents were happy with the.

56
00:01:59.401 --> 00:01:59.800
Children.

57
00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.700
I know it's a it's AI, don't know that one.

58
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:04.000
No, but that doesn't mean anything.

59
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:04.800
I didn't even go to college.

60
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:05.500
What did you study at?

61
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:13.000
College I double majored theatre and international relations and then I went and worked for the US embassy for a bit and here in Argentina I'm Buenos that's.

62
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.600
Sensational when you speak.

63
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:15.100
Spanish.

64
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.600
I do now, but they have very different kind of Spanish.

65
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:20.400
It's Castigiano, so it almost sounds like Italian, yeah.

66
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:27.400
Exactly.

68
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:30.000
What's the common ago?

69
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:30.400
Yeah.

70
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:33.800
You didn't know I spoke Italian did.

71
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:34.700
You didn't.

72
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.700
So you speak a lot of different languages or just that?

73
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:41.000
I studied French for eight years and now it's deplorable.

74
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.500
I can't remember anything which is I.

75
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:44.100
Think the word you're looking for is.

76
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.200
Yes, that's exactly what I see.

77
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:48.600
My point?

78
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.200
Exactly.

79
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.200
Have you ever been to Paris?

80
00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:50.900
I have.

81
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:52.900
Did you meet James Marsden when you were there?

82
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:54.400
I didn't.

83
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:55.600
We should have crossed paths.

84
00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:57.800
Yeah, I think he would have been fine with that.

85
00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:58.200
Yeah.

86
00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:00.800
Where when were you in Paris?

87
00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:01.600
What did you did you study?

88
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.600
There or I did not.

89
00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:07.200
I was actually just in Paris a couple a couple months ago with one of my cast mates we went for a wedding just for.

90
00:03:07.401 --> 00:03:08.300
Really.

91
00:03:08.301 --> 00:03:10.400
Yeah, 'cause we film in Toronto, so it's not too far.

92
00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:11.400
Toronto, Canada.

93
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:13.000
Yes, that's the big one.

94
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:13.600
The land.

95
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.000
Yes, I know a lot more about Maple syrup now.

96
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.300
No, actually Toronto, I think.

97
00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:22.000
Very international city really, isn't it?

98
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.100
Yeah, it's a very lovely place, almost as nice as Montreal.

99
00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:26.100
I look forward to the lettuce.

100
00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:26.700
Canadians.

101
00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:32.800
But where are you from?

102
00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:33.200
Isn't he?

103
00:03:33.201 --> 00:03:34.200
I'm born and raised here in LA.

104
00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:35.200
Los Angeles.

105
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.200
Yes, I'm one of the five.

106
00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:36.800
You can pinch me.

107
00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:37.500
I'm real.

108
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:38.000
See.

109
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:38.800
Oh, yes.

110
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.000
No, I'm from here.

111
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:40.500
I'm from here.

112
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:41.300
No.

113
00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:43.200
I just wanted to do it again.

114
00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:46.600
Strangely hairless body you have.

115
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.700
You're quite the dolphin, aren't you?

116
00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:55.000
It's not easy being.

117
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.200
I tell you, you're absolutely hair free.

118
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:01.100
Well, are you?

119
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:03.000
Are you a competitive swimmer?

120
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:06.300
I am not, but if I were to be 1 I think I would get some.

121
00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:08.900
That's what you need to do if you're a competitive swimmer.

122
00:04:08.901 --> 00:04:10.200
Shave yourself entirely.

123
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.100
OK, good.

124
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:15.600
I did that once in Canada I did, and Winnipeg once I was.

125
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:16.300
Yeah, I did.

126
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:17.100
I was snowed in, yeah.

127
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:19.399
I didn't know what to do, so I shaved my whole body.

128
00:04:20.701 --> 00:04:21.600
That is just.

129
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.300
AI looked like a giant baby.

130
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:25.600
Just swimming like that.

131
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:27.300
Yeah, yeah, giant swimming, baby.

132
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:28.300
Giant swimming, baby.

133
00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:29.700
Yeah, it's like a callback.

134
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.500
You grew up here.

135
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.200
I did.

136
00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:34.000
Are your parents in show business?

137
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.200
My dad is ADP.

138
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:37.200
Yes, I he was the lighting director.

139
00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:42.400
Director of photography, my dad.

140
00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:46.300
I didn't mean to make it sound so.

141
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:47.200
It's all right.

142
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:47.800
It's I'm just.

143
00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:48.600
It's fine.

144
00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:48.900
Help.

145
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:49.200
Yes.

146
00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:49.900
Yeah, thank you.

147
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:50.800
Has he been on anything?

148
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:51.300
I would know.

149
00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:53.400
There was a show called Married with Children.

150
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:53.700
Do you seen?

151
00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:54.200
It seen it.

152
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:55.000
Yeah, absolutely.

153
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.600
Yeah, so I grew up on the set of Married with Children.

154
00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:59.700
Every day after school for 10 years I was there.

155
00:04:59.701 --> 00:04:59.800
Wow.

156
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:08.100
I know it's a very perverse place for a little girl who went to Catholic school, no less, to grow up because I'm there in my school uniform, Right.

157
00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:09.100
And then the guests.

158
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:13.700
Joke.

159
00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.200
It's a joke, kind of a joke and.

160
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:20.800
Then the guest stars would be like Tracy Lords, Tia Carrera.

161
00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:21.500
You know these.

162
00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:21.800
Yeah.

163
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:23.900
Those are some, yeah, yeah.

164
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:25.300
Some women, yeah.

165
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:26.600
And so, yeah.

166
00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:30.200
They must have been interested in you walking around in your little schoolgirl outfit.

167
00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:31.600
Did they think you were working on the show?

168
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:32.100
Perhaps?

169
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:33.800
Thankfully, no.

170
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:34.200
Come on.

171
00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:37.300
Curly, curly hair and gap in my teeth and yeah.

172
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:39.000
Did you see the rest of the people on the show?

173
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:41.900
That's fine.

174
00:05:42.501 --> 00:05:43.500
Yeah, I guess it could have worked.

175
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:44.600
I mean, they watched me grow.

176
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:46.000
So is your hair curly naturally then?

177
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:46.700
Is that what you're saying?

178
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:49.900
It doesn't remember what it once was, but yes, I don't.

179
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:51.400
I mean, Once Upon a time it was curly.

180
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:52.000
Yeah, really.

181
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:54.000
Yeah, I had very curly hair.

182
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:54.600
Did you know?

183
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:55.900
I bet it's.

184
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:58.000
I have to iron it to get it like that.

185
00:05:58.001 --> 00:05:59.900
Iron it, lots of product you do.

186
00:06:00.101 --> 00:06:01.600
Yeah, I like to put products in my hair.

187
00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:01.700
You.

188
00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:02.500
Do you have great?

189
00:06:02.501 --> 00:06:06.700
Hair, yeah, but products from the supermarket such actually produce.

190
00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:07.800
That's why I like.

191
00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:09.000
Yeah, yeah, I like.

192
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.200
Puree some broccoli.

193
00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:13.900
Broccoli and other vegetables for.

194
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:15.800
Oh, fibre in your hair.

195
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:16.800
Yeah.

196
00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:18.600
Fibre, I think that's a strong choice.

197
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:19.400
Thanks.

198
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:21.800
Yeah, we should be best friends.

199
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:25.200
We'll have a little broccoli slumber party.

200
00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:28.100
Megan's also my wife's name.

201
00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:30.600
Is it really?

202
00:06:31.201 --> 00:06:32.300
Does she spell it with an H?

203
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:32.700
No.

204
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:34.500
Too poor as a child?

205
00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:38.600
They can only get the five letter I'm.

206
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:41.300
Afraid we can't afford the extra H?

207
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:47.600
You can either keep the child and lose the H, or keep the H and lose the child, whatever you prefer.

208
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.600
Amazing.

209
00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:49.400
Yeah, they kept her.

210
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:51.300
And now you have the good fortune of having her.

211
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:51.600
Megan.

212
00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:52.000
No H.

213
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:53.300
Megan.

214
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.600
No, H That's what I call it.

215
00:06:59.401 --> 00:06:59.600
Yeah.

216
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:00.400
It's a joke, baby.

217
00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:00.800
It's a joke.

218
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:03.600
Oh no, it's fine, fine.

219
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:04.900
Well, let's call her Meg.

220
00:07:05.101 --> 00:07:05.800
And we're both.

221
00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:06.400
Don't call her Meg.

222
00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:06.900
She didn't like that.

223
00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:07.800
Do you like getting called Meg?

224
00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:09.700
Yeah, I get called Meg Nutmeg.

225
00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:10.400
Nutmeg.

226
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:16.600
All right, let's do an awkward pause and get you out of here.

227
00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:17.400
OK, Yeah.

228
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:06.000
None.
