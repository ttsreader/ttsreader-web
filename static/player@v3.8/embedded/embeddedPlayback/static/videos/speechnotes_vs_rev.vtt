1
00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:07.600
So we decided to do a head to head battle between two leading AI transcription service providers, Speech Notes and Rev.

2
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:15.400
We'll be comparing them on accuracy, speed and price, as well as privacy, ease of use and translation options.

3
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:23.000
We used the exact same YouTube video for both services, providing a mix of clear and challenging audio elements.

4
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.400
Both sites accept uploading files as well as links to online recordings.

5
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:32.500
On both sites, we simply paste the link to the YouTube video.

6
00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:38.900
Then we select the language and number of speakers and upload pricing.

7
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:44.200
Speech Notes is $0.10 a minute, while Rev is $0.25 a minute.

8
00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:50.600
So Speech Notes is the big winner in the pricing category with less than half the price speed.

9
00:00:51.501 --> 00:01:00.000
Speech Notes got the results ready within approximately a minute and 1/2, while the same task took Rev more than 3 minutes to finish.

10
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:05.800
So Speech Notes wins the speed category big time, bringing results twice as fast.

11
00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:10.100
So far, Speech Notes is half the price and twice as fast.

12
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:11.700
But how is the accuracy?

13
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:14.800
Both services brought excellent results.

14
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:24.500
Perhaps Speech Notes was being just a bit more accurate in a few words, but since it's so close, it's fair to conclude both got the same score for accuracy.

15
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:32.500
Privacy is crucial, and both services declare similar high standards of privacy for their AI transcription service.

16
00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:35.600
Finally, translation options.

17
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:48.800
Speech Notes is a world pioneer offering instant automatic translations to any language and to many languages at once from the transcription results you already got, while Rev does not have that feature at all.

18
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:54.800
To conclude, the ultimate winner of our transcription battle is Speech Notes.

19
00:01:54.801 --> 00:02:05.700
Hands down bringing the best AI engines at half the price, ease of use and solid performance across the board, Speech Notes is the top choice for your transcription needs.
