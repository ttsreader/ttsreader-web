// Note: this is a guide for the new player. In addition to the new player, you should know we have the [legacy player](/legacy/) and the [web-player](/webplayer/).

## Quick Start

* Go to [ttsreader.com/player/](https://ttsreader.com/player/)
* Paste your text
* Select your language & preferred voice
* Click Play

That's All!

<br/>

## The Controller

<div style="max-width: 750px; margin: 20px auto; border-radius: 20px;overflow: hidden">

## Download the Synthesized Speech as an mp3 Audio File

On Windows machines, TTSReader can record in real time the synthesized speech, and save it as an mp3 audio file.

This is done by clicking the "Record" button, and then following the instructions on the screen.

Here's a hands-on video that shows how to do it. In short - simply click the "Record" button, then follow the instructions on the screen. When done click the "Record" button again, and the mp3 file will be generated and downloaded to your computer.

The only tricky part is Share popup window - there you have to select the 'Entire Screen' tab -> then click the screen image itself -> then make sure 'Share System Audio' is checked -> then click 'Share'.

Here's the short video showing it all in action:

<div class="videowrapper">
  <iframe style="display: block" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq09r01GetQ?rel=0" title="YouTube video player - Generate audio mp3 files from synthesized speech with TTSReader" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<br/>

When recording is done - click on the Record button again to stop recording. The mp3 file will be generated and downloaded to your computer.

## When is a Commercial License Necessary?

A commercial license is necessary when using TTSReader within a business, or when using the generated audio for publishing. See more [here](/docs/guides/commercial/).

<br/>


## Upgrading to Premium

You can upgrade to premium [here](https://ttsreader.com/upgrade/).

<br/>


## Add pauses to the audio

You may add 1 second long pause by inserting the following text: `{{pause}}` (with 2 curly brackets on each side) in the text.

<br/>

## More voices

Need more voices? Here are some tips:

<p>- More voices are available when using TTSReader on Chrome / Edge browsers. Specifically - on Chrome - Noah is our recommendation. On Edge - Christopher &amp; Michelle are both exceptional!</p>

<div>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">Here are some of the available voices:</p>
  <p><u>On Edge:</u></p>
  <div>Christopher: <audio style="vertical-align: middle" controls="" src="/player/audio/Christopher.mp3" preload="metadata"></audio></div>
  <div>Michelle: <audio controls="" src="/player/audio/Michelle.mp3" preload="metadata"></audio></div>
  <br>
  <p><u>On Chrome:</u></p>
  <div>Noah: <audio controls="" src="/player/audio/Noah.mp3" preload="metadata"></audio></div>
  <div>Lily: <audio controls="" src="/player/audio/Lily.mp3" preload="metadata"></audio></div>
  <br>

<p>- Using custom SAPI5 voices is possible on Windows using Firefox browser.</p>
<p>- On mobile, you will find more voices using our <a href="/mobile/" target="_blank">text-to-speech mobile apps</a></p>
<p>- We're working on making even more voices available for <a href="/upgrade/" target="_blank">Premium users</a>.</p>

Using custom SAPI5 voices is possible on Windows using Firefox browser. See example here:
