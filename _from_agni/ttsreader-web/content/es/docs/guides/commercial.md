## Once upgraded, which Voices Can be Used for Publishing?

**Important note:**

We can only give you permission for publishing recorded voices that their name ends with a single or double asterisk (ie - * or **). Use Google Chrome to get enable more voices. Other voices may be installed on your device, which means you can use them on your device, but not necessarily allowed to publish them.
