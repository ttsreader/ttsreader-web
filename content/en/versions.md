Change log of TTSReader versions & links to stable, previous & preview versions. It's recommended to always use the PREVIEW (not stable) version, as the risk is low. If something doesn't work, you can always switch back to the stable version. In that case, please report the issue to us on our [Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecnm9ZnFje9S6OSSQqP4Ts4av-hSmhAUbuLvQAojWUdckAtg/viewform?usp=sf_link) or on our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/GQT5f5kM). Please specify the feedback is for the PREVIEW version, and include the link to the version you used. Thank you!!!
