# Additional methods for adding text-to-speech to a site:

In order to add text-to-speech to a site, one has 2 options, which then split to more options themselves.

The main 2 options are:
1) Pre-recording of the text - if the text does not change - that could be a valid option. Then - you simply serve the same static pre-generated mp3 file to all users that request it.
2) Generating the text-to-speech on the fly. This is more suitable if the content is dynamic. It also lets users select their preferred voice, etc. It can do translations as well - everything on the fly. This option now splits further into 2 sub-options for the text-synthesizer. You could use text-synthesizers that come via the web-speech-API or text-synthesizers that are served as a service by Microsoft usually via API.
- (a) Web-speech-API advantage - does not charge per use - free for any scale. Disadvantage - support & voices may vary between platforms.
- (b) Microsoft API advantage - high quality consistent voices on any platform. Disadvantages - may become very expensive for high volumes.

We - at ttsreader - can make all 3 options work best for you. We mainly specialize in 2(a) - this is how ttsreader.com itself operates and this is how we are able to give it for free for unlimited usage.

You could of course develop your own player using any one of these routes. Our advantage is that we're always 'on it' anyhow - so it's probably more efficient for you to simply use our player - as we're working on it every day anyhow, we update it, fix, find workarounds to bugs introduced by the OS or browsers or speech engines, etc.

Our business model is basically -
1) Free player if you take it as-is. What do we get from it? Your visitors, see the player - and may click the info icon on it and then get to know us or even click on the link to ttsreader.com.
2) If you need customizations we would have to charge something - but - my guess is that it's at least 50% less than other vendors.
3) If you need a whole new project tailored to your needs - we should discuss the details to understand better. Everything is possible.

Hope this helps, would love to hear your thoughts,

Ronen
