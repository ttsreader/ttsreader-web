## Watch the live comparison here.

<br>

We just stumbled upon this very interesting YouTube, demoing live comparison of top speech to text solutions online.

The blogger here simply searched 'text to speech' on Google, and then tested all the different free websites that he got on the first search results.
It's all done live - so you can see the websites and hear the different voices on each one.
He uses the same text for all websites - so you actually get a very good comparison of the different text to speech solutions.

Here is the YouTube - so you can watch it right here and now:
