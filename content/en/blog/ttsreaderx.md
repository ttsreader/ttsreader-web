## 2025-May-18 Update

The Chrome extension is temporarily unavailable on the Chrome store due to updates in the Chrome store versions (shifting to manifest v3). We are working on a new version that will be available soon - and will also incorporate cutting edge AI voices! We'll keep you updated on the progress.

#### We're working on an update - in the meantime our new player can import webpages - just paste the link

You can import any page into our [new text & webpage player](https://ttsreader.com/player/) and listen to it there. The web app is available on all platforms, including mobile. Simply copy the URL of the page you want to read, paste it into the player's URL import and click "GO". Or - even simpler - make sure the player's text area is empty (or empty it using the trash-icon button) and paste the URL into the text area. Then simply click 'Play'. The player will automatically detect that it's a URL and will import the page for you.

Here are the 2 options in pictures:

(1) Import webpage via the URL import button:

(2) Import webpage via the text area directly:

![Import webpage via the text area directly](/images/screenshots/player/link_inline_800x.webp 'Import webpage via the text area directly')

Then - simply click 'Play' and enjoy listening to the page! The webpage will load into the player and will be read out loud. You can also use the player to edit the text, change the voice, speed, pitch, etc. The player is available on all platforms - including mobile.

### Have your own website? You can add TTSReader's Plugin to it - to make it readable!

## Readability (Clean Page) Mode

TTSReader-X uses novel algorithms to extract the main content of any webpage. As such, it can also transform your page to main-content-text only. Removes any clutter from the website, so you can focus on the article. In this mode, you can also customize font size and print a clean printer-friendly version of the site - without background and irrelevant content.
