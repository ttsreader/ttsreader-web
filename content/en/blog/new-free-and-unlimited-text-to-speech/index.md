Exciting news for all TTSReader users and the text-to-speech community! TTSReader has just made a significant change: **all regular voices are now free and unlimited**. This means you can enjoy the full range of non-premium voices without any restrictions, making it easier than ever to convert text to speech.

In addition to the free regular voices, TTSReader is also introducing **premium AI voices**. These voices are available for free testing, allowing you to experience their quality before committing to a purchase. After the free testing period, premium AI voices will be available for a small fee, ensuring that you can access high-quality text-to-speech capabilities without breaking the bank.

We're also the only ones to offer (as far as we know) Pay-as-you-go non=recurring - no subscription, no commitment packages for the premium AI voices.

These changes ship with version 3.5.+ which is now available as our main player version at [https://ttsreader.com/player/](https://ttsreader.com/player/).
