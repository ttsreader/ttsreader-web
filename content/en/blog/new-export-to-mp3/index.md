Continuing TTSReader's fast development, today we're launching a new feature - we've all been waiting for. Generate MP3 / WAV files from text - super fast with a single click. Available on [TTSReader's new text-to-speech reader](https://ttsreader.com/player/).

Currently it has some limitations - such as up to 5k chars, without the ability to mix voices, but we're working on solving them as well. The vision is to be able to be able to create long, multi-voice narrations with a single click.

The biggest advantage of the new development over the previous RECORD option is speed. While with RECORD you had to actually play the text in real time in order to record it, with the new export functionality it's generated on our server at a high speed. So generating 6 minutes of audio file, only takes about 20 seconds.

<br/>

You should also know, that using this new functionality - you own the full copyrights to the generated audio! So you can use the generated audio for ANY purpose, even commercially and for publishing.

<br/>

Here's the new export button:
