The launch of our audio export feature. Generate MP3 / WAV files from text - super fast with a single click. Available on [TTSReader's new text-to-speech reader](https://ttsreader.com/player/).

<br/>

Here's the short video showing it all in action:

The biggest advantage of the new export feature over the previous RECORD option is speed. While with RECORD you had to actually play the text in real time in order to record it, with the new export functionality it's generated on our server at a high speed. So generating hours of audio file, only takes a minute or two.

<br/>

You should also know, that using this new functionality - you own the full copyrights to the generated audio! So you can use the generated audio for ANY purpose, commercially and for publishing.

Here's the new export button:

All exports above 2000 characters get automatically stored in our server and can be accessed later from your

This feature is a gamechanger for content creators, educators, and anyone who needs high-quality audio quickly and easily.
