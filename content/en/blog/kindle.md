Exciting news! Kindle lovers now got upgraded with some new great features.
TTSReader on the Kindle can read out loud any text, pdf and website. It uses the latest algorithms to extract only the relevant text out of the usually-cluttered websites.

Great for listening to Wiki articles for instance, blogs and more.

With the new app, you can also send your friends audio messages! Write the message in the app, let it be read out loud. Send the generated voice message to friends via messaging, Whatsapp, or any other social media. It's a lot of fun!

## Podcast Written Texts

### While working, or driving, listen to interesting articles and books

TTSReader for Android is ideal for people who want to be able to listen to written content while doing something else. The reason it's an especially good fit is **TRIPLE**:

1. It's on your mobile device - take it anywhere.
2. It works offline (once you have the text itself of course).
3. It saves you money - as it (a) works offline (b) free (as opposed to many podcasts) (c) text (used for ttsreader) is much less data than audio (used for other podcasts). TTSReader doesn't download heavy audio files - it generates the audio on the fly.


## Enjoy Infinite Content

Podcasts are becoming popular, but still, the amount of freely available high quality written content is incomparably larger. Enjoy all that wealth with our reader.
