## Use ANY voice installed on your computer with TTSReader!

<br/>

I was so excited when I found out about this! You can use ANY custom SAPI5 voice installed on your Windows PC with ttsreader.com!

### 1) Use any voice to enhance the reading experience

Why is this exciting? Since you may now use many more voices, including custom / tailored / high fidelity voices you purchased and installed with our simple to use, light weight effective player.

### 2) Use your own voice!

And also - and this was new to me - since apparently - technology has reached a level where you can create your own synthesized voice, that mimics exactly your own voice. Very cool. And for people who are about to lose their voice - this is more than simply cool - it's a way to keep their own voice!
This service - of recording your won voice - in order to create a synthetic voice that mimics it via SAPI5 interface - is given by [Acapela-Group](https://www.acapela-group.com/).

Credit for bringing this use case, and requesting this feature to JC. Thank you JC!

Here's a short video demoing my own synthesized voice reading out some text on ttsreader:

<b>Important note: </b>currently it only works on ttsreader.com when using the Firefox browser.
