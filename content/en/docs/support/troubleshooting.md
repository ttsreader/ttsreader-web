{{< details "Cannot hear anything" >}}
- The most common issue here is because one of the following:
  - Your device is on silent
  - Device volume set to very low
  - Speakers are turned off
- How to tell?
  - Does other music play? Try a YouTube.
  - Does the player highlight sentences and moves forward? If so, then the issue is with the sound.
- If it's not the volume - try a different browser. Chrome is recommended. If the issue is on mobile, try installing our [mobile app](/mobile/)
