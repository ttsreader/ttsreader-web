## New Community!!

Excited to open our new space for our community to connect, share ideas, and provide feedback. We value your input and want to hear from you!

It's a great opportunity to connect with other users, share your experiences, and help us improve our product.

Here's a link to our new community space: [Join TTSReader's community](https://discord.gg/GQT5f5kM)

This will eventually - we believe - become the main place for discussions, feedback and issues reporting.

Our developers are very active there as well - so - your feedback will be heard, taken into consideration and responded to.
