## Overview

Different plans and pricing models are available in order to accommodate all our users and fit their needs and budgets. From free personal use to advanced plans for power users, businesses, APIs, and automations.

**NOTE: ALL IS ACCORDING TO OUR TEMS AND CONDITIONS** - see our [Terms of Service](/docs/legal/terms/) for details. The terms are updated from time to time.

All plans refer to the TTSReader.com web app & API. New mobile apps and browser-extensions are under development and when published will also be included under these plans. Legacy mobile apps and Chrome extension are mostly free and are not included in these plans.

The paid plans are required for private power-users, businesses, organizations, schools, colleges, commercial use, publishing and selling the generated audio, API, bots and any automations. The paid plans cover our new player, API, Chrome extension, other browser extensions. It will cover our mobile apps as well, when they will be updated. Currently (as of 2025-05-18) the mobile apps are (unfortunately) outdated and have their own independent plans (which is mostly free). There are 3 complementary paid plans:
* [Premium plan](#2-premium-plan) - single seat premium for most users.
* [Premium Plus plan](#3-premium-plus-plan) - single seat premium for top 5% heavy users. To be developed in the future.
* [Pay-as-you-go plan](#4-pay-as-you-go-plan) - for API users and for those who need to exceed the limits of the Premium and Premium Plus plans.

## Plans

### 3. Premium Plus Plan

Not yet available, but coming soon.

<br/>

### 4. Pay-as-you-go Plan

#### Scope

Intended for anyone who prefers to only pay for what they actually use - and for users who need to exceed the limits of the Premium and Premium Plus plans. This plan is based on pre-purchasing credits. It is perfect for API users.

#### Quotas for the Pay-as-you-go Plan are:

Unlimited for as long as your account has remaining credits available. Fill up your credits as needed. The credits are consumed by the number of characters actually generated by your account. The credits expire after 1 year - which is extended to 1 year on every new purchase - so even older credits get the expiration extended to 1 year from the last purchase. If the account has both a premium plan and credits, then the credits will be consumed only after the quota of the premium plan is reached.

#### Pricing

Credits are purchased in different packages:
- 200k chars: $10
- 1M chars: $32
- 10M chars: $300

See [comparison table](#comparison-table) to compare the different plans.
