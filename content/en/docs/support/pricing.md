## Overview

Different plans and pricing models are available in order to accommodate all our users and fit their needs and budgets. From free personal use to advanced plans for power users, businesses, APIs, and automations.

All plans refer to the TTSReader.com web app & API. New mobile apps and browser-extensions are under development and when published will also be included under these plans. Legacy mobile apps and Chrome extension are mostly free and are not included in these plans.

The paid plans are required for private power-users, businesses, organizations, schools, colleges, commercial use, publishing and selling the generated audio, API, bots and any automations. The paid plans cover our new player, API, Chrome extension, other browser extensions. It will cover our mobile apps as well, when they will be updated. Currently (as of 2025-05-18) the mobile apps are (unfortunately) outdated and have their own independent plans (which is mostly free). There are 3 complementary paid plans:
* [Premium plan](#2-premium-plan) - single seat premium for most users.
* [Premium Plus plan](#3-premium-plus-plan) - single seat premium for top 5% heavy users.
* [Pay-as-you-go plan](#4-pay-as-you-go-plan) - for API users and for those who need to exceed the limits of the Premium and Premium Plus plans.

## Plans

### 1. Free Plan

#### Scope

The free plan is meant for personal use only, or for testing purposes prior to purchasing. Please upgrade to a paid plan if you need to use TTSReader for any of the following: heavy usage, or any usage in a businesses or organizational setup, commercial use, API, bots, automation, or publishing or selling the generated audio.


#### Quotas for the free plan are:

As of 2025-05-18 the free plan is limited to:

* Unlimited for the [legacy player](/legacy/).
* Limited on the [new text-to-speech-player](/player/) to 3k chars of non premium voices per day and to 3k chars of premium voices per account total. That may change from time to time.

### 2. Premium Plan

#### Scope

- Based on a monthly subscription / yearly license - and is meant for a single seat normal use per account. As such, it is limited to normal no-abuse single-seat usage, that is based on common usage stats. Single seat user license - not for multiple users. Multiple users require multiple licenses - 1 for each user, or purchasing credits via the Pay-as-you-go plan.

#### Quotas for the Premium Plan are:

As of 2025-05-18 the premium plan is limited to:

* Non premium voices: unlimited. This is both for the legacy player and the new player.

#### Pricing

You can choose between a monthly subscription or a yearly license. The advantages of the yearly license are 2 fold: (1) cheaper per month, and (2) it does not auto-renew - so you can choose to renew it or not at the end of the year.

* Monthly subscription: $10.99 per month.
* Yearly license: $48 per whole year (ie only $4 per month, this is circa 60% off the monthly subscription). This is a one-time payment for a whole year. It does not auto-renew. You can choose to renew it or not at the end of the year.

### 4. Pay-as-you-go Plan

#### Scope

Intended for anyone who prefers to only pay for what they actually use - and for users who need to exceed the limits of the Premium and Premium Plus plans. This plan is based on pre-purchasing credits. It is perfect for API users.

#### Quotas for the Pay-as-you-go Plan are:

Unlimited for as long as your account has remaining credits available. Fill up your credits as needed. The credits are consumed by the number of characters actually generated by your account. The credits expire after 1 year - which is extended to 1 year on every new purchase - so even older credits get the expiration extended to 1 year from the last purchase. If the account has both a premium plan and credits, then the credits will be consumed only after the quota of the premium plan is reached.

#### Pricing

Credits are purchased in different packages:
- 200k chars: $10
- 1M chars: $40
- 10M chars: $300
- 100M chars: $2000
