## Speech Recognition Engines

- Dictation: web speech API
- Transcription: server side powered by Google's / Microsoft's speech to text engines.


## Hosting

Hosted on Google Cloud


## App technology

The app itself is built on JavaScript, using npm. The code behind it is not open source.

We are open sourcing the wrapper javascript library around the web speech API.

## Site technology

The website around the app, landing page, docs, etc. is based on [Doks](https://doks.netlify.app) which is an amazing open source Hugo theme. We found Doks to be simply a piece of art. Doks is powered by Hugo & npm in a great hybrid that brings a lot of power, beauty and efficiency to this template / Hugo theme.
