## General

<p>We at Speechnotes, Speechlogger, TextHear, Speechkeys value your privacy, and that's why we do not store anything you say or type or in fact any other data about you - unless it is solely needed for the purpose of your operation. We don't share it with 3rd parties, other than Google / Microsoft for the speech-to-text engine.
</p>
<br/>


## Handling recordings and results

### - Transcription service
<p>Our transcription service is probably the most private and secure transcription service available.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HIPAA compliant.</li>
  <li>No human in the loop. No passing your recording between PCs, emails, employees, etc.</li>
  <li>Secure encrypted communications (https) with and between our servers.</li>
  <li>Recordings are automatically deleted from our servers as soon as the transcription is done.</li>
  <li>Our contract with Google / Microsoft (our speech engines providers) prohibits them from keeping any audio or results.</li>
  <li>Transcription results are securely kept on our secure database. Only you have access to them - only if you sign in (or provide your secret credentials through the API)</li>
  <li>You may choose to delete the transcription results - once you do - no copy remains on our servers.</li>
</ul>

### - Dictation notepad & extension

<p>For dictation, the recording & recognition - is delegated to and done by the browser (Chrome / Edge) or operating system (Android). So, we never even have access to the recorded audio, and Edge's / Chrome's / Android's (depending the one you use) privacy policy apply here.
</p>
<p>The results of the dictation are saved locally on your machine - via the browser's / app's local storage. It never gets to our servers. So, as long as your device is private - your notes are private.</p>
<br/>

## Payments method privacy

<p>The whole payments process is delegated to PayPal / Stripe / Google Pay / Play Store / App Store and secured by these providers. We never receive any of your credit card information.</p>
<br/>

## More generic notes regarding our site, cookies, analytics, ads, etc.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We may use Google Analytics on our site - which is a generic tool to track usage statistics.</li>
  <li>We use cookies - which means we save data on your browser to send to our servers when needed. This is used for instance to sign you in, and then keep you signed in.</li>
  <li>For the dictation tool - we use your browser's local storage to store your notes, so you can access them later.</li>
  <li>Non premium dictation tool serves ads by Google. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ads Settings</a>. Alternatively, users can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://youradchoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://youradchoices.com/</a></li>
  <li>In case you would like to upload files to Google Drive directly from Speechnotes - we'll ask for your permission to do so. We will use that permission for that purpose only - syncing your speech-notes to your Google Drive, per your request.</li>
</ul>
