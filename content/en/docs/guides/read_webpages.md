You can import any page into our [new text & webpage player](https://ttsreader.com/player/) and listen to it there. The web app is available on all platforms, including mobile. Simply copy the URL of the page you want to read, paste it into the player's URL import and click "GO". Or - even simpler - make sure the player's text area is empty (or empty it using the trash-icon button) and paste the URL into the text area. Then simply click 'Play'. The player will automatically detect that it's a URL and will import the page for you.

Here are the 2 options in pictures:

(1) Import webpage via the URL import button:

(2) Import webpage via the text area directly:

![Import webpage via the text area directly](/images/screenshots/player/link_inline_800x.webp 'Import webpage via the text area directly')

Then - simply click 'Play' and enjoy listening to the page! The webpage will load into the player and will be read out loud. You can also use the player to edit the text, change the voice, speed, pitch, etc. The player is available on all platforms - including mobile.
