## Introduction

TTSReader's player at [https://ttsreader.com/player/](https://ttsreader.com/player/) allows you to convert any text into speech and create your own personal podcast channel. You can then import this channel into popular podcast apps like Apple's Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and more. This guide will walk you through the process step by step.

## Step 1: Create Your Podcast Channel with TTSReader

1. **Access the TTSReader Player**: Go to [https://ttsreader.com/player/](https://ttsreader.com/player/) in your web browser.

2. **Prepare Your Content**: Enter the text you want to convert to speech. TTSReader supports various input methods including pasting text, uploading files, or entering URLs.

3. **Enable Podcast Export**: Before generating the audio, make sure to check the "Add to Podcast" option. This will make your generated audio available as a podcast episode.

4. **Generate and Export**: Click the "Export MP3" button to create your audio file. TTSReader will process your text and generate the speech audio.

5. **Copy the Podcast URL**: After export, you'll see a podcast URL. Copy this URL, as you'll need it to subscribe in your podcast app.

## Tips and Notes

- **Multiple Episodes**: Each time you export new content from TTSReader with "Add to Podcast" enabled, it becomes a new episode in your channel.
- **RSS Feed**: The URL you copy is an RSS feed URL that any podcast app can subscribe to.
- **Privacy**: Your podcast episodes are generated on-demand and stored on our server with public access, so they can be available to the podcasts apps. If your content is sensitive - it's recommended NOT to add it to your podcast channel - as it may be indexed by the 3rd party apps playing your podcast.
- **Publish**: You can share and publish your channel so others can enjoy. For example - if you are a teacher - you can create a channel for your classroom. Share with co-workers, friends, family and more.
- **Customization**: You can customize the voice, speed, and other settings in TTSReader before exporting.
- **Cross-Platform**: The same podcast URL works across all devices and podcast apps that support RSS feeds.

Now you can enjoy your personalized text-to-speech content anywhere, just like a regular podcast!
