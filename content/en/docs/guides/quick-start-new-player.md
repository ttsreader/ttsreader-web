That's All!

## Advanced Options for Exporting for Publishing

See here: [Generating Professional Voiceovers](/docs/guides/voiceover/)


## Download the Synthesized Speech as an mp3 Audio File

### First option - single click to export

See details here: [How to export to MP3 with a single click on TTSReader](/blog/new-single-click-export-text-to-audio-feature/)


<a id="record"></a>
### 2nd option - Record as it Plays

On Windows machines, TTSReader can record in real time the synthesized speech, and save it as an mp3 audio file.

This is done by clicking the "Record" button, and then following the instructions on the screen.

Here's a hands-on video that shows how to do it. In short - simply click the "Record" button, then follow the instructions on the screen. When done click the "Record" button again, and the mp3 file will be generated and downloaded to your computer.

The only tricky part is Share popup window - there you have to select the 'Entire Screen' tab -> then click the screen image itself -> then make sure 'Share System Audio' is checked -> then click 'Share'.

Here's the short video showing it all in action:

<div class="videowrapper">
  <iframe style="display: block" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq09r01GetQ?rel=0" title="YouTube video player - Generate audio mp3 files from synthesized speech with TTSReader" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<br/>

When recording is done - click on the Record button again to stop recording. The mp3 file will be generated and downloaded to your computer.

## When is a Commercial License Necessary?

A commercial license is necessary when using TTSReader within a business, or when using the generated audio for publishing. See more [here](/docs/guides/commercial/).

<br/>


## Upgrading to Premium

You can upgrade to premium [here](https://ttsreader.com/upgrade/).

<br/>


## Add pauses to the audio

You may add 1 second long pause by inserting the following text: `{{pause}}` (with 2 curly brackets on each side) in the text.

<br/>

<p>- We're working on making more voices available for <a href="/upgrade/" target="_blank">Premium users</a>.</p>

### Custom SAPI5 Voices

Using custom SAPI5 voices is possible on Windows using Firefox browser. See example here:
