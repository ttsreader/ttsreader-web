// Note: this is a guide for the new player. In addition to the new player, you should know we have the [legacy player](/legacy/) and the [web-player](/webplayer/).

## Quick Start

That's All!

## The Controller

## Downloading the Audio as a File

On Windows machines, it is possible to record in real time the audio generated by TTSReader, and save it as a file.

This is done by clicking the "Record" button, and then following the instructions on the screen.

When recording is done - ie when you click to stop it - the audio will be saved as a .webm file and downloaded to your computer. You can then convert it to mp3 using our tool [here](/converters/) or any other tool you like.

<br/>



## When is a Commercial License Necessary?

A commercial license is necessary when using TTSReader within a business, or when using the generated audio for publishing. See more [here](/docs/guides/commercial/).
