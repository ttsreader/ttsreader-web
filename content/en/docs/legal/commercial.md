## When is a Commercial License Necessary?

A commercial license is necessary when using TTSReader commercially (ie within a business setup), or when using the generated audio for publishing. Publishing includes YouTubes, telephony messages, presentations, automatic messages in reception rooms, shops, etc., and any other use to generate audio that is for more than personal-listening use.

### Using ttsreader.com within a business or for-profit organization
If you are a business, or working on behalf of a business, or a for-profit organization, using ttsreader.com, please use our [premium plan](https://ttsreader.com/upgrade/).

<br/>

### Using the generated speech for publishing
Recording and using the audio generated by TTSReader in a commercial application and / or for publishing purposes requires a commercial license. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Add generated speech for narrating YouTube Videos
* Speech for telephony messages
* Presentations - slide shows
* Automatic messages in reception rooms, shops, etc.
* Speech for game-characters
* Speech for apps

For any publishing please use our [premium plan](https://ttsreader.com/upgrade/)

## Once upgraded, which Voices Can be Used for Publishing?

**Important note:**

ALL premium voices are allowed for publishing. These include ALL voices that the quick [export-to-mp3](https://ttsreader.com/blog/new-single-click-export-text-to-audio-feature/) button generates.

Non premium voices - most non premium voices are also allowed for publishing when upgraded to premium. However, some specific voices - those that are brought in from Apple if you are a Mac user, are not allowed for publishing. To make sure the voice you use is allowed for publishing - click on the voice-selector, and in the voices-list a green checkmark indicates your voice is OK to be published.

## Contractual Terms for Using The Generated Speech Commercially

### Terms and End User License Agreement (EULA)

1) Voice that you are allowed to publish:
- All premium voices
- Any audio that is generated with the quick [export-to-mp3](https://ttsreader.com/blog/new-single-click-export-text-to-audio-feature/) button.
- Any generated speech that uses voices that have a checkmark sign next to them in the voice selection dropdown. Here's a screenshot showing you how this checkmark looks like:

2) You cannot re-sell our service.

3) Service is on AS-IS basis on ttsreader.com. We do our best to keep it alive and bug-free - and it is our interest - but - we can not guarantee.

4) Once audio is generated in the license period - you can use it even after license has expired!

5) Each premium account is for a single person - ie 1 seat per account - and the reader should not be abused by bots or other non-personal use - should not be used via API, or for quantities that do not make for normal 1 seat usage. If you need API access or larger quota - please contact us at contact@ttsreader.com - please specify in the title: "TTSReader API & Quota request".

<br/>

### Who Owns the Copyrights to the generated Speech?

You do. See our [post about it](https://ttsreader.com/blog/2017/05/10/copyright/) for details.

<br/>

### Would you like to upgrade to Premium?

**It's only a few dollars - and straightforward, unlimited publishing rights, given the above terms (mainly the voice selection limitation to those with checkmark).**

* Probably the best value for money.
* One time payment - no subscription - for a whole 1 year long license.
* Once audio is generated in the license period - you can use it even after license has expired!
* No limits to the audio length or quantity you can generate.
* Generate mp3 files - EXACTLY - as previewed!
