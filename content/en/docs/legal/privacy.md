## General

We at TTSReader value your privacy, and that's why we do not store anything you say or type or in fact any other data about you - unless it is solely needed for the purpose of your operation. We don't share it with 3rd parties, other than what is minimally necessary in order for the service to work. That includes:

* Sending text (without your identity) to world-leading voice providers, such as: Google / Microsoft / OpenAI / ElevenLabs / Your operating system / browser / Other Leading Voice Vendors for the text-to-speech engine.
* Sharing data with PayPal or Stripe or other payment-processor provider for payment processing.
* Sharing data with Google or other cloud service providers for cloud-syncing your text, if you choose to do so.
* Sharing data with accountants or lawyers or other service providers for the purpose of running our business, and only if absolutely necessary.
* Sharing data with our trusted developers for the purpose of development, and only if absolutely necessary.
* Sharing data with law enforcement or other authorities if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with the law, protect our rights or property, or protect the safety of our users or the public.
<br/>

## Updates to this Privacy Policy

As we keep developing our service, adding new features and adapting it to environment changes, technical changes, legal changes, and other changes, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
