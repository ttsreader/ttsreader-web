## TL&DR (In Short)

While we do our best to develop & maintain the best [text-to-speech service](/) in the world and keep it as such forever and ever, we make no commitment, no liability, no warranty, and we will not be held accountable for anything as much as permitted by law. All products & services are AS-IS, use at your own risk, can change any time without notice. We also hold the right to stop the service for all or specific accounts without notice.

## Plans, Quotas, and No Abuse

18. Free Plan

The free plan is meant for personal use only, or for testing purposes. It is not meant for commercial use, and it is not meant for heavy usage. If you are using TTSReader for commercial purposes, or if you are using it heavily, please upgrade to a paid plan. It is not allowed to use the free plan for commercial purposes, or for API, or automatic processes (bots or other programmatic use). Quotas for the free plan are: unlimited for the [legacy player](/legacy/). Limited on the [new text-to-speech-player](/player/) to a number of characters per day that may change from time to time. Generated audio under the free plan is not allowed for publishing or selling. Not to be sold, resold, or abused. For a single personal use only.

As of 2025-05-18 the free plan is limited to 3k chars of non premium voices per day and to 3k chars of premium voices per account total. If you need more than that, or need to use it commercially, or for a business, or you need to publish or sell the generated audio, or you need to use it programatically or via automation or API, please upgrade to a paid plan.

<br/>

19. Paid Plans

The paid plans are required for private power-users, businesses, organizations, schools, colleges, commercial use, publishing and selling the generated audio, API, bots and any automations. The paid plans cover our new player, API, Chrome extension, other browser extensions. It will cover our mobile apps as well, when they will be updated. Currently (as of 2025-05-18) the mobile apps are (unfortunately) outdated and have their own independent plans (which is mostly free). There are 3 complementary paid plans:

  - **Premium** Plan - based on a monthly subscription / yearly license - and is meant for a single seat normal use per account. As such, it is limited to normal no-abuse single-seat usage, that is based on common usage stats. Single seat user license - not for multiple users. Multiple users require multiple licenses - 1 for each user, or purchasing credits via the Pay-as-you-go plan. As of 2025-05-18 the limits to the Premium plan are:
    - Non premium voices: unlimited.
    - Premium voices: 200k chars per day and 1M chars per month.
<br/><br/>
  - **Premium Plus** Plan - like the Premium Plan but for the top 5% of our heavy-users. Single seat user license - not for multiple users. Multiple users require multiple licenses - 1 for each user, or purchasing credits via the Pay-as-you-go plan. As of 2025-05-18 the limits for the Premium Plus plan are:
    - Non premium voices: unlimited.
    - Premium voices: 500k chars per day and 2.5M chars per month.
<br/><br/>
  - **Pay-as-you-go** Plan - for anyone who prefers to only pay for what they actually use - and for users who need to exceed the limits of the Premium and Premium Plus plans. This plan is based on pre-purchasing credits. It is perfect for API users. Credits are consumed by the number of characters actually generated by your account. Credits expire after 1 year - which is extended to 1 year on every new purchase - so even older credits get the expiration extended to 1 year from the last purchase. If the account has both a premium plan and credits, then the credits will be consumed only after the quota of the premium plan is reached.
