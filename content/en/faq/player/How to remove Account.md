I want to remove my account and all my data from TTSReader, how can I do this?

## Answer
We respect the privacy of our users. Any user is able to remove their
account along with all its associated data. To remove an account, you
need to follow the following steps.

1) Go to the player at [TTSReader Player](https://ttsreader.com/player/)

2)  Ensure you are signed in to the account you wish to remove

3)  In the left sidebar menu click on the option "Manage Account".

4)  At the bottom (Below the Danger Zone) click "Remove Account". A
    confirmation log will appear confirming the account removal.

Once the account is removed all data associated including account
information, history, exported data, is removed permanently from
TTSReader's systems.
