## Question

How are character credits counted?


## Answer
Premium accounts include character credits based on the plan you choose.
For example, subscription plans provide **1 million characters per
month**.

We calculate character usage with fairness in mind and avoid counting
credits when not absolutely necessary:

- **Forward caching** -- Just like other streaming services (such as
  YouTube) we buffer our text rendering a couple of seconds forward. The
  text is cached in the system and the characters are
  counted toward your monthly allotment.

- **Replays of the same text** --- If a text has already been cached,
  replaying it will reuse the cached version. No additional characters
  are counted.

- **Changing the text** --- If you change the text, the voice, or the
  playback speed, the system must re-render the audio. In these cases,
  the characters will be counted toward your monthly
  allotment.

- **Exports** - If you have LONG text that you want to listen to more
  than once - you can use the export button. The number of characters in
  the export process is counted towards your monthly
  allotment. Once generated via export you can listen to it again as
  many times as you want and NO chars will be charged.
