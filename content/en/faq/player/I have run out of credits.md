## Question

I have run out of characters using my standard subscription, how can I get more character credits?

## Answer

Premium plan credits are logged per use. To understand how the credits
are counted please review the following FAQ -- How are character credits
counted?

Once you have reached the limit of the credits available you have
several options to increase your character credit count to keep using
the reader.

1)  Consider waiting for the credit reset at the beginning of the next
    cycle: Credits are reset on the first (1^st^) of every month. Total
    Credits are reset to 1 million characters.

2)  Revert to Free voices with no limitations.

3)  Buy (one time) Pay as you Go credits. There are three Pay as you Go credit
    options.

    a.  200k characters at 10 USD.

    b.  1 million characters at 32 USD.

    c.  10 million characters at 300 USD.

**Any unused character credits carry over and are applied only after the
current cycle's credits are exhausted.**
