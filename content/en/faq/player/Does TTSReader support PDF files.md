## Question

Does TTSReader support PDFs?

## Answer
Yes, TTSReader supports the uploading of textual PDF files.

Since there are some difficulties when parsing PDF files it is important to review the loaded text pedantically in order to ensure its accuracy and correct flow.
PDF files can be uploaded via the “Open file” option in the TTSReader player header.

TTSReader’s development team works continuously on improving its PDF parsing capabilities. If there are any files that are not uploading sufficiently please contact the team at contact@ttsreader.com.
